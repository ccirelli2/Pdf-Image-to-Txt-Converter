Background1\\\\n\\\\nThe Plaintiffs are Georgia construction workers Who were hired by the\\\\nDefendant Pittman Consultants, Inc. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a general contracting corporation located in\\\\nGeorgia \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 to travel to Covington, Kentucky to work on a construction project from\\\\nSeptember 2014 to March 2015.2 The Plaintiffs do not hold special licenses or\\\\ncertificates, but are experienced painters and carpenters.3 Prior to traveling to\\\\nKentucky, the Plaintiffs completed employment applications With Pittman\\\\nConsultants.4 The Plaintiffs transported basic equipment such as paint brushes,\\\\nladders, drills, and wrenches to Kentucky.5 Pittman Consultants provided speciality\\\\n\\\\nequipment, including safety harnesses, sprayer tips, and hard hats.6 In addition, the\\\\n\\\\n1 The Court draws the material facts almost entirely from the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts. \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 N.D.

As a result, this\\\\nfactor weighs in favor of employee status as well.47 Fourth, the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 jobs do not\\\\n\\\\nrequire special licenses or certifications. While the Plaintiffs are skilled painters and\\\\n\\\\n44 Id., at 36\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9437, 50\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9451.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n45 Id., at 48; Mosley Dep., at 24.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n46 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 Scantland, 721 F.3d at 1317 (finding that the plaintiffs had little\\\\nopportunity for profit because, inter alia, they \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccould not negotiate or otherwise\\\\ndetermine the rates they were paid for their jobs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and their \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cability to earn additional\\\\nincome through their own initiative was limited\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d).\\\\n\\\\n47 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 Demers V.

They simply followed the Pittman Consultants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and IBG Construction\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s schedule\\\\nand instructions. Fifth, the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 duties are clearly integral to Pittman\\\\nConsultants. The Defendant is a general contractor for residential and commercial\\\\nconstruction proj ects. And, obviously, most construction proj ects need carpenters and\\\\npainters. Additionally, the Defendant Pittman acknowledged that IBG Construction\\\\nwould not have paid Pittman Consultants but for the Plaintiffs performing their\\\\nduties.50\\\\n\\\\nThe only factor that supports an independent contractor status is duration. The\\\\nPlaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 jobs only lasted siX months. There was no permanency in their relationship\\\\n\\\\nWith Pittman Consultants. Despite the lack of permanency, the Court finds that the\\\\n\\\\n48\\\\n\\\\nBrock V.

Thus, the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nMotion for Partial Summary J udgment is granted as to the issue of employee status.\\\\n\\\\nNext, the Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on the\\\\nissue of liquidated damages. They contend that the Defendants failed to present any\\\\nevidence that their alleged Violation of the FLSA was in good faith. Parties \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwho\\\\nprevail under the FLSA are entitled to recover liquidated damages unless the employer\\\\nmakes an affirmative showing that it acted in good faith.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d51 The inquiry into whether\\\\nan employer acted with a good faith belief contains both a subjective and objective\\\\ncomponent.52 The subj ective component addresses the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s actualbelief,whi1e\\\\nthe objective component looks at the reasonableness of the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s belief and\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crequires some duty to investigate potential liability under the FLSA.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d53 Here, the\\\\nDefendants have failed to satisfy their burden. While Pittman appears to have held a\\\\nsubj ective belief that the Defendants were in compliance with the FLSA, there is no\\\\nevidence that the Defendants held an objectively reasonable belief that they were in\\\\n\\\\ncompliance. Specifically, there is no evidence that Pittman conducted an investigation\\\\n\\\\n51\\\\n\\\\nOjeda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Sanchez V. Bland Farms, LLC, 499 F.

So While the\\\\nPlaintiffs are a construction crew that traveled to another state, the Court is not\\\\nconvinced that the regulation intended a single trip to be sufficient. Moreover, the\\\\nCourt \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 through its own research \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 was unable to locate a single case that found one\\\\nout-of-state trip to be sufficient.\\\\n\\\\nIn response, the Plaintiffs point to J osendis V.

The relevant case\\\\nlaw is in agreement With the regulation. Courts that have examined the issue have\\\\ndone so on a case-by-case basis. For example, in Bowrin V. Catholic Guardian\\\\nMy, the court found that the plaintiff employees Who traveled out of state weekly\\\\nor two to four times per month established individual coverage, but the plaintiff\\\\nemployees Who traveled out of state only twice in their three years of employment did\\\\nnot establish individual coverage.33 As a result, the Court disagrees With the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\ncontention that traveling across state lines automatically qualifies an employee for\\\\nindividual coverage.\\\\n\\\\nThe Court concludes that the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Motion for Partial Summary J udgment\\\\n\\\\nregarding the issue of individual coverage should be denied.34 Nevertheless, the Court\\\\n\\\\n32 29 C.F.R. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 776.12.\\\\n33 417 F.

Based upon information and belief, the annual gross sales volume of\\\\nDefendant was in excess of $500,000.00 per annum at all times material hereto.\\\\n\\\\n9. At all times pertinent to this Complaint, Defendant was an enterprise\\\\nengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce as de\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ned by \\\\xc2\\\\xa7\\\\xc2\\\\xa7\\\\n3(r) and 3(s) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 203(r) and 203(s).\\\\n\\\\nPARTIES\\\\n\\\\n10. Plaintiff is an adult individual who is a resident of Decatur, Georgia.\\\\nPlaintiff was employed by Defendant from approximately October 2013 to\\\\nNovember 2014 in Lawrenceville, Gwinnett County, Georgia.\\\\n\\\\n11. Plaintiff is a covered employee within the meaning of the FLSA.\\\\n\\\\n12. Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s written consent is attached hereto as Exhibit A.\\\\n\\\\n13. WIRELESS VISION is a Michigan limited liability company with a\\\\nprincipal place of business in Bloom\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81eld Hills, Michigan. At all times material,\\\\nDefendant conducted business in the state of Georgia.\\\\n\\\\n14. WIRELESS VISION is a covered employer within the meaning of the\\\\nFLSA, and, at all times relevant, employed Plaintiff and similarly situated\\\\n\\\\nemployees.\\\\n\\\\nPage-3 -of11Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 4 of 11\\\\n\\\\n15. WIRELESS VISION is the entity listed on Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s paystubs and\\\\nW-ZS.\\\\n\\\\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\\\\n\\\\n16. During the three (3) year period immediately preceding the \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ling of\\\\nthis action (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe relevant period\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), Defendant employed Plaintiff and similarly\\\\nsituated employees Within the meaning of the FLSA. Defendant has had\\\\nsubstantial control over working conditions of Plaintiff and similarly situated\\\\nemployees, and the unlawful policies and practices alleged herein.\\\\n\\\\n17. WIRELESS VISION regularly required Assistant Managers to work\\\\nin excess of forty (40) hours per week.\\\\n\\\\n18. The primary duties of Assistant Managers are non-exempt, and\\\\ninclude customer service, making sales to customers, and assisting customers With\\\\ntheir service requests.\\\\n\\\\n19. These primary duties do not vary significantly from one WIRELESS\\\\nVISION location to another.\\\\n\\\\n20. The primary duties of Assistant Managers do not fall under any of the\\\\nexemptions under the FLSA.\\\\n\\\\n21. During the relevant period, Plaintiff and similarly situated Assistant\\\\n\\\\nManagers worked over forty (40) hours in one or more work weeks they were\\\\n\\\\nemployed by WIRELESS VISION.\\\\n\\\\nPage-4-of11Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 5 of 11\\\\n\\\\n22. Throughout the relevant period, it has been WIRELESS VISION\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\npolicy to uniformly classify Assistant Managers as exempt from overtime\\\\nprovisions of the FLSA, and not to pay them any overtime wages.\\\\n\\\\n23. During the relevant period, WIRELESS VISION paid its Assistant\\\\nManagers a base weekly salary plus commission, but not time and one-half wages\\\\nfor their hours worked over forty (40) in a work week, Which is a Violation of the\\\\nFLSA.\\\\n\\\\n24. Plaintiff and the putative class members all perform or performed the\\\\nsame primary duties.\\\\n\\\\n25. WIRELESS VISION applies the same employment policies,\\\\npractices, and procedures to all Assistant Managers.\\\\n\\\\n26. WIRELESS VISION did not keep accurate records of hours worked\\\\nby Assistant Managers, including Plaintiff. That is, although Assistant Managers\\\\nroutinely worked more than forty (40) hours, WIRELESS VISION did not record\\\\nthose hours.\\\\n\\\\n27. WIRELESS VISION was aware that Assistant Managers, including\\\\nPlaintiff and the putative class members, worked more than forty (40) hours per\\\\nwork week, yet WIRELESS VISION failed to pay them any overtime compensation\\\\nfor any of the hours worked over forty (40) in a work week.\\\\n\\\\n28. As part of its regular business practice, WIRELESS VISION has\\\\n\\\\nPage-S-ofllCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 6 of 11\\\\n\\\\nintentionally, willfully, and repeatedly engaged in a pattern, practice, and/or policy\\\\nof Violating the FLSA With respect to Plaintiff and the putative class members. This\\\\npolicy and pattern or practice includes, but is not limited to:\\\\n\\\\na. willfully failing to pay Plaintiff and the putative class members\\\\n\\\\novertime wages for hours that they worked in excess of forty\\\\n(40) hours per work week;\\\\n\\\\nb. Will\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81illy misclassifying Plaintiff and the putative class as exempt\\\\nfrom the protections of the FLSA; and\\\\n\\\\nc. willfully failing to record all of the time that its employees,\\\\n\\\\nincluding Plaintiff and the putative class members, have worked\\\\nfor the bene\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81t of WIRELESS VISION.\\\\n\\\\n29. There are many similarly situated current and former Assistant\\\\nManagers Whom have not been paid proper overtime wages in Violation of the\\\\nFLSA and Whom would bene\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81t from the issuance of a court-supervised notice of\\\\nthis lawsuit and the opportunity to join it. Thus, notice should be sent to the\\\\nputative class members pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 216(b).\\\\n\\\\n30. The putative class members are known to Defendant, are readily\\\\nidenti\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81able, and can be located through Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s records.\\\\n\\\\n31. By the conduct described in this Complaint, WIRELESS VISION has\\\\nviolated the FLSA by failing to pay Assistant Managers, including Plaintiff and the\\\\nputative class members the overtime wages they have earned and to Which they are\\\\nentitled by law.\\\\n\\\\n32. WIRELESS VISION is aware or should have been aware that the\\\\n\\\\nPage-6-of11Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 7 of 11\\\\n\\\\nFLSA required it to pay employees performing non-exempt duties, including\\\\nPlaintiff and the putative class members, an overtime premium for hours worked in\\\\n\\\\nexcess of forty (40) per work week.\\\\n\\\\n33. WIRELESS VISION\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unlaw\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81il conduct has been Widespread,\\\\nrepeated, and consistent.\\\\n\\\\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\\\\nFair Labor Standards Act \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Overtime Wages\\\\n\\\\n34. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in 1H] 1\\\\n\\\\nthrough 33.\\\\n\\\\n35. WIRELESS VISION has engaged in a Widespread pattern and\\\\npractice of Violating the FLSA, as described in this Complaint.\\\\n\\\\n36. The overtime wage provisions set forth in \\\\xc2\\\\xa7\\\\xc2\\\\xa7 201 et seq. of the FLSA\\\\napply to WIRELESS VISION.\\\\n\\\\n37. WIRELESS VISION has failed to pay Plaintiff and the putative class\\\\nmembers the overtime wages to Which they were entitled under the FLSA.\\\\n\\\\n38. WIRELESS VISION\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Violations of the FLSA, as described in this\\\\nComplaint, have been willful and intentional.\\\\n\\\\n39.

Mr. Sharp not being\\\\nquick to form any opinion and call this discrimination, Mr. Sharp began taking note.\\\\n\\\\n21) As set forth in greater detail below, throughout his employment at the Company,\\\\n\\\\nMr. Sharp both observed and was subject to many incidents where he and other black\\\\nemployees were treated differently on the basis of their race/color, national origin.\\\\n\\\\n22) On or about April 22, 2015, black Night manager Edward Thomas (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Thomas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d)\\\\naccused Mr. Schlinkert of failing to allow him to negotiate his annual salary from\\\\nAssistant Night Manager to Night Warehouse Manager as promised during the\\\\ninterview.

Mr. Schlinkert stated he was the only\\\\nmanager left in building, which would require him to stay if he left. Mr. Sharp said he\\\\nwasn\\\\\\'t expecting Mr. Thomas to be discharged during the meeting and was too sick to\\\\nstay, he would be leaving. Mr. Schlinkert in an attempt to create fear in Mr. Sharp about\\\\nleaving sick, he stated \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have some decisions to make\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d.

Ms. Babbit in the best interest of the Company attempted to explain the\\\\ndisparity of treatment among blacks and whites.

The Complaint was properly served on all\\\\nDefendants (Docs. 3, 4, 5, 6]. On January 28, 2016 Garmon filed a\\\\nFirst Amended Complaint [Doc. 9], which was served on all Defendants\\\\n[;g; at 31]. Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s First Amended Complaint brought claims for:\\\\n\\\\n0 (l) homepayment of overtime wages under the Fair Labor\\\\n\\\\nStandards Act (FLSA)1;\\\\n\\\\n0 (2) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention;\\\\n0 (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress;\\\\no (4) battery;\\\\n\\\\n0 (5) assault;\\\\n\\\\n0 (6) false imprisonment;\\\\n\\\\n..

On February 16, 2016 Seals and Corporate Defendants2\\\\nfiled an Answer to Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s First Amended Complaint and Counterclaims\\\\n\\\\nagainst Garmon [Doc. 12]. Seals and Corporate Defendants\\\\n\\\\n1Although the First Amended Complaint indicates that this FLSA\\\\nclaim is brought on behalf of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlaintiff and the Collective Classes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n[Doc. 9 at 11], the Court cannot find evidence of a Class on behalf\\\\nof which Plaintiff brought suit. The Court therefore assumes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand\\\\nthe Collective Classes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was a typographical error, and Plaintiff is\\\\nsuing solely on his own behalf.\\\\n\\\\n2The Court notes that the Counterclaims purport to have been\\\\nfiled solely by Defendants Seals and Seals Entertainment Company, LLC\\\\n[Doc. 12 at 47]. Out of an abundance of caution, the Court assumes\\\\n\\\\nthat the Counterclaims were brought by all Defendants.\\\\n\\\\n2Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 56 Filed 02/22/17 Page 3 of 8\\\\n\\\\ncounterclaimed against Garmon for: (1) conversion, (2) breach of\\\\ncontract, (3) invasion of privacy, (4) defamation, (5) intentional\\\\ninfliction. of emotional distress, and (6) attorneys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fees and\\\\nexpenses (lg; at 53\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9459].

Chanel, Inc. v.\\\\n\\\\nItalian Activewear of F1a., Inc., 931 F.2d 1472, 1477 (11th Cir.\\\\n1991). At that time, the nonmoving party must present \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csignificant,\\\\n\\\\nprobative evidence demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of\\\\n\\\\nfact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id. If the nonmoving party fails to do so, the moving party\\\\nis entitled to summary judgment. United States v. Four Parcels of\\\\nReal Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1438 (11th Cir. 1991).\\\\n\\\\nA11 evidence and justifiable factual inferences should.be viewed\\\\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

J\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. However, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe mere\\\\nexistence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will\\\\n\\\\nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion. for summaryCase 1:15-cv-O4394-ODE Document 56 Filed 02/22/17 Page 5 of 8\\\\n\\\\njudgment; the requirement is that there be In) genuine issue of\\\\nmaterial fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d lg; at 247\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9448 (emphasis in original).\\\\n\\\\nHere, Garmon has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [DOC. 40].\\\\nThat Motion jjS well-supported knr declarations from Plaintiff and\\\\nprevious employees of some of the Defendants, screenshots of texts,\\\\nand audio and Video evidence [see Docs. 40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x942, 40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x943, 40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x944, 40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x945, 39].\\\\nDefendants have filed 51 Response iJ1 Opposition [Doc. 42].

In his Reply, Garmon argues that summary judgment is\\\\nappropriate on all claims and counterclaims because Defendants have\\\\nfailed to adequately respond to his Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc.\\\\n47 at 2\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x947]. Garmon further argues that Corporate Defendants should\\\\nbe defaulted for failure to obtain counsel [;g; at 7\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x948].\\\\n\\\\nUnder the Local Rules, unless the respondent specifically objects\\\\nor counters, the Court admits material facts a movant alleges in\\\\nsupport of a motion for summary judgment, and finds them supported by\\\\nthe evidence the movant Cites.

Thus,\\\\nGarmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s material facts are admitted as supported and unopposed, and\\\\n\\\\non that basis, Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 40] is\\\\n\\\\nGRANTED as to all claims and counterclaims in this case.Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 56 Filed 02/22/17 Page 6 of 8\\\\n\\\\nB.

During his employment with Defendants, that\\\\nposition was Garmon\\\\\\'s sole employment and sole source of income LLQ;\\\\n\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 22 (citing Doc. 40-3 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 22)]. Throughout his employment, Garmon\\\\\\'s\\\\nonly office was a room in Defendant Seals\\\\\\' residence [Doc. 67 at 4\\\\n(citing Doc. 40-3 1 23, Doc. 40-4 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 4)].\\\\n\\\\nDuring the first seven weeks of Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s employment, through\\\\nDecember 27, 2014, Garmon was paid a regular rate of $10.00 per hour\\\\n[;g; (citing Garmon Test.)]. From November 9, 2014 to December 27,\\\\n2014 Garmon worked approximately 46 hours per week [lgA (citing\\\\nGarmon Test.)]. From December 28, 2014 to the end of his employment,\\\\nGarmon was paid a regular rate of $12.00 per hour [;g; at 5 (citing\\\\nGarmon Test.)]. From December 28, 2014 through March 28, 2015 Garmon\\\\nworked approximately 60 hours per week for ten of those weeks, and\\\\napproximatelyr 46 hours per\\\\\\' week. the remaining\\\\\\' three \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98weeks [;g;\\\\n(citing Garmon Test.)]. From March 29, 2015 through October 17, 2015\\\\nGarmon worked a total of 247 overtime hours [;g; (citing Garmon\\\\nTBst.)]. Defendants knew of and/or approved the overtime hours\\\\nGarmon worked [;g; at 6 (citing Doc. 40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x943 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 30)]. At no time during\\\\nGarmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s employment did Defendants ever pay Garmon one-and a\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94half\\\\ntimes his regular pay rate for his overtime hours; he only ever\\\\nearned his regular pay rate for overtime hours [l\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81L at 5 (citing\\\\nGarmon Test.)].\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, Garmon is owed $3,000 in overtime pay. The Court\\\\nassesses an additional award of $3,000 in liquidated damages.\\\\n\\\\nTurning to the other claims, the evidence shows that during the\\\\n\\\\none year period of Garmon\\\\\\'s employment Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 treatment of him was\\\\n\\\\n4Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 5 of 8\\\\n\\\\nabusive and controlling to a pathological degree. Seals admits that\\\\nhe has an anger management problem for which he has sought treatment.\\\\nSeals frequently screamed at Garmon, in whom he did not have much\\\\nconfidence and vented his anger by issuing commands and comments\\\\nwhich frequently were demeaning. The evidence depicted Garmon as an\\\\nemotionally fragile person who found it difficult to cope with Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\naggressive manner. Seals understood Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fragility. Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nabuse of Garmon took the form of screaming at him, threatening him,\\\\ninsisting that Garmon participate in unwelcome sexual activity, and\\\\nmaking sexual jokes and comments at Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expense. Garmon was\\\\nafraid of Seals.\\\\n\\\\nThe Court accepts Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 testimony that his treatment of Garmon\\\\nwas not uniformly negative. Specifically, when Garmon threatened to\\\\ncommit suicide Seals called the United Way Suicide Hotline and\\\\nobtained counseling for Garmon. He also kept Garmon on as an\\\\nemployee although he felt Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s performance was inadequate. He\\\\ntold Garmon he could take time off to look for a new job, if he\\\\nwanted to so do. On one evening, Seals was contacted by police\\\\nconcerning Garmon. Garmon had gone to meet another man for a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csexual\\\\nhookup\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d; the other man.was involved in illegal drugs and was arrested\\\\nat the scene by police. Garmon was not arrested; Seals went to get\\\\nGarmon and took him home. Garmon and Seals frequently went out to\\\\nlunch together; Seals always paid the bill.\\\\n\\\\nGarmon credibly testified that Seals required him.to participate\\\\nin some sexual activity despite his objection. He testified that\\\\n\\\\nSeals required him to provide oral sex at least 15 times, purportedly\\\\nto relieve Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 stress and that Seals required him, three or four\\\\n\\\\ntimes, to shave \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cevery inch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d of Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 body. The Court accepts\\\\n\\\\n5Case 1:15-cv-04394\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 6 of 8\\\\n\\\\nGarmon\\\\\\'s testimony that Seals threatened to tell Garmon\\\\\\'s grandfather\\\\nthat Garmon was gay if he did not provide oral sex to Seals.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, the Court accepts other testimony by Garmon as\\\\nfollows.\\\\n\\\\nSeals participated. in. numerous group texts with. other\\\\\\' men\\\\naffiliated with the Corporate Defendants. Garmon was also included.\\\\nThese texts sometimes demeaned Garmon. For example, Seals texted\\\\nthat Garmon had \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98demon seed,\\\\\\'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d wore diapers, was a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98stud,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\" and was\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[good at] sliding \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98his sausage\\\\\\' in\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [Doc. 67 at 10 (citing Doc. 40-3\\\\n\\\\nW 42, Garmon Test., Doc. 66-1)]. Seals also sent the group a picture\\\\n\\\\nof someone\\\\\\'s naked buttocks, and texted \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Andrew cries and asks\\\\nvendors to f**k him even harder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [Id. at 10\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9411 (citing Doc. 40-3\\\\nW 42, Garmon Test., Doc. 66-1)]. On or around June 4, 2015 in\\\\n\\\\nanother group text with the same group, the CFO\\\\\\'s brother texted a\\\\npicture of movie theater seats that had penises sticking out of them;\\\\nSeals replied \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why is Andrew not seating [sic.] in one of those\\\\nchairs?\\\\\\'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [;g; at 11 (citing Doc. 40-3 W 44, Garmon Test., Doc. 66\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n1)]. Another time, Seals texted Garmon a picture of a person\\\\\\'s bare\\\\nbuttocks with a pitchfork shoved through them and a message stating\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is what I am going to do to you on Halloween!!\\\\\\'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [lgA at 10\\\\n(citing Doc. 40-3 W 41, Garmon Test., Doc. 66\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x941)].\\\\n\\\\nThe evidence which is most influential in awarding damages is a\\\\nvideo recording made by Garmon without Seals\\\\\\' knowledge on\\\\nNovember 2, 2015. On that morning, Seals (who was in the shower)\\\\nreceived a cell phone call from a client who wanted to know what was\\\\nthe problem with the company\\\\\\'s land line. The client had been trying\\\\nto reach Seals through the company land line and evidently had been\\\\n\\\\ntold that the telephone number was not in service. Seals was\\\\n\\\\n6Case 1:15-cv-04394\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 7 of 8\\\\n\\\\nembarrassed. He blamed the failure to pay the telephone bill on\\\\nGarmon. Seals flew into a rage, essentially cornering Garmon in the\\\\nroom connecting to the shower. Seals continually barked out orders\\\\nto Garmon to get the telephone company on the line and get the line\\\\nreconnected. However, Garmon was terrified by Seals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anger and\\\\nthreatening demeanor and was tongue\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94tied. All of the foregoing is\\\\ncaptured on the video. Seals dismisses the video as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca setup,\" but\\\\nSeals\\\\\\' actions certainly are accurately captured. While Seals\\\\ntemporarily blocked the door to the room so that Garmon could not\\\\nleave, that only lasted a few minutes. Garmon worked at the office\\\\nfor the rest of that day. However, when he left that evening he\\\\nresolved not to and did not return.\\\\n\\\\nDuring his employment Garmon had difficulty sleeping at night\\\\nbecause he was worried about what might happen at work the next day\\\\n[Doc. 67 at 14 (citing Doc. 40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x943 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 52, Garmon Test.)]. At work,\\\\nGarmon was stressed, never knowing what Seals might do next, and when\\\\nSeals did act out, Garmon was humiliated [;g; at 14-15 (citing Doc.\\\\n40\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x943 \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 52, Garmon Test.)]. Near the end of his employment, Garmon\\\\nwould go home crying at night [Garmon Test., Wagner Test.]. Garmon\\\\nlost approximately 25 pounds during the one year term of his\\\\nemployment. .lg; He became nervous and apprehensive. He has sought\\\\ntherapy.\\\\n\\\\nIn assessing damages, the Court considers that Garmon.could.have\\\\nleft his employment with Defendants long before he did; certainly,\\\\nwithin four months of beginning work Garmon knew the score concerning\\\\nthe work environment. Garmon\\\\\\'s explanation that he could not leave\\\\nearlier because he was supporting his mother and sister is\\\\n\\\\nunconvincing. The Court does not reject his testimony that he sent\\\\n\\\\n7Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 8 of 8\\\\n\\\\nmoney to his mother and sister, but does question his assertion that\\\\nthis made it impossible for him to leave. He could have looked for\\\\nanother job. This has a big impact on awardable damages.\\\\n\\\\nLeaving aside the FLSA claims, the damages award on Garmon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress subsumes the\\\\ndamages awardable on all other claims (battery, negligent hiring,\\\\nassault, false imprisonment). One award of compensatory damages will\\\\nbe made on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and\\\\nno additional damages will be awarded on the other state law claims.\\\\nDamages are awarded, as follows: $6,000 on the overtime claim under\\\\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act but zero dollars for the retaliation\\\\nclaim under the FLSA; $25,000 compensatory damages on the intentional\\\\ninfliction of emotional distress claim, no additional compensatory\\\\ndamages on the battery, negligent hiring, assault and false\\\\nimprisonment claims, $10,000 punitive damages on the claim for\\\\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. Should Plaintiff wish\\\\nto seek an award of attorneys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fees his application must be filed\\\\nwithin ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Order. Defendant\\\\nmay file opposition within twenty (20) days of the date of entry of\\\\nthis Order.

[Doc. 32.]\\\\n\\\\nThe first count of Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amended complaint is brought under Title\\\\nVII. [Doc. 22 at 6.] Willocks alleges that she was in the following three\\\\nprotected classes: a Hispanic individual from Panama; black; and being from\\\\nPanama and having an accent. [Id.] She alleges that Kindred discriminated\\\\nagainst her because of her race, color, and/or national origin in firing her, and that\\\\nits motivation in firing her was, in whole or in part, based on those three factors.\\\\n[Id. at 7.] Willocks further alleges that Kindred retaliated against her for refusing\\\\nto participate in its scheme to systematically force older Hispanic employees to\\\\n\\\\nquit 0r retire.

[Doc. 36-5 ][ 24.] Schmitt further\\\\nstated that the reasons for firing Willocks were the suspected falsification of\\\\ndocuments and the failure to follow Harrilson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s directive to give her the\\\\ndocumentation before giving it to the auditor. [Doc. 36-4 ][ 16.] Schmitt and\\\\nGibson also both stated that neither spoke with Hoffmann concerning Willocks or\\\\nthe issues related to her termination.

[Id.] Willocks admits that she did not complain to anyone about\\\\nbeing mistreated on account of her disability, and she admits that none of the\\\\npeople who decided to fire her were aware of Willocks having requested any\\\\naccommodation. [Doc. 36-8 M 77-78.]\\\\nIll. Evidentiary Rulings\\\\n\\\\nIn its reply brief, Kindred objects wholesale t0 the consideration of two\\\\npieces of evidence submitted along with Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s response to Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion\\\\nfor summary judgment. [See Doc. 39 at 4-8.] Specifically, it objects to Exhibit A\\\\nof Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration and Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration. [Id.] Before addressing the\\\\n\\\\nmerits of the case, I will address each evidentiary objection in turn.\\\\n\\\\n5 The statement of material facts states that this date was in 2014, but that\\\\nappears to be a typographical error.\\\\n\\\\n12Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 13 of 45\\\\n\\\\nA. Exhibit A to Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration is probative of none of\\\\nWillocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arguments, and therefore will not be considered in\\\\nmy analysis of the summary judgment motion.\\\\n\\\\nExhibit A of Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration is a two-page printout detailing an\\\\nanonymous December 2011 phone call complaining of discrimination at Kindred.\\\\n[Doc. 38-3 at 9-10.] The report details that an anonymous caller complained that\\\\ntwo employees\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Jamila Blossomgame and Patricia Brown\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94were unprofessional\\\\nand were singling out older employees for firing. [Id. at 9.] The caller also stated\\\\nthat those two employees were singling out Willocks for termination. [Id.] The\\\\ndocument also contains notes on the investigation into the complaints,\\\\npresumably by human resources, and each complaint was found to be\\\\nunsubstantiated. [Id. at 9-10.]\\\\n\\\\nNothing on the face of the document makes clear who created the\\\\ndocument or what entity maintained the document. [See Doc. 38-3 at 9-10.]\\\\nLikewise, Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration does not purport to state anything about the\\\\ndocument\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s creation or maintenance. [See id. at 3-7.] The only reference to\\\\nExhibit A in Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration appears to be paragraph 15, where Willocks\\\\n\\\\nrelies on the document to state that somebody filed a complaint with Kindred in\\\\n\\\\nDecember 2011 regarding age discrimination. [Id. HI 15 .]\\\\n\\\\n13Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 14 of 45\\\\n\\\\nKindred makes three arguments as to why Exhibit A should be stricken.\\\\nSpecifically, it argues that (1) the document is not authenticated; (2) the document\\\\nwas not produced during discovery despite being responsive to discovery\\\\nrequests; and (3) the exhibit is based, in large part, on inadmissible hearsay. [Doc.\\\\n39 at 4\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x946.]\\\\n\\\\nBased on Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s response brief, she appears to be putting forth the\\\\nexhibit as evidence related to her retaliation claim. [See Doc. 38 at 7, 9.] She\\\\nargues that it is relevant that she was discriminated against shortly after the\\\\npurported age discrimination scheme was reported to the Kindred hotline, [id. at\\\\n7], and that the exhibit is relevant to show that Willocks opposed the purported\\\\nscheme, [id. at 9].\\\\n\\\\nEven accepting the document as properly authenticated and otherwise\\\\nadmissible, it is not at all clear how the challenged exhibit could support any of\\\\nWillocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s contentions unless Willocks herself placed the phone call to Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhotline and that someone at Kindred was aware of that fact. Nothing in the record\\\\nsupports either proposition. Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own declaration states, in reference to the\\\\ndocument, that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csomeone called Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s complaint line.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [Doc. 38-3 at 4.] I\\\\n\\\\ntherefore find it unnecessary to decide whether Exhibit A should be stricken as\\\\n\\\\n14Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 15 of 45\\\\n\\\\ninadmissible at trial. As it is probative of none of the arguments advanced by\\\\nWillocks, the document Will simply not add anything to my analysis.\\\\n\\\\nB. The bulk of the statements in Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration are\\\\ninadmissible as being beyond the scope of the witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ncompetency.\\\\n\\\\nKindred also argues that the Thigpen declaration is inadmissible. [Doc. 39\\\\nat 6-8.] Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s argument on this point is a bit scattershot, alternatively\\\\nasserting that the declaration is irrelevant, hearsay, and impermissible 1ay opinion\\\\ntestimony, Without developing or separating those contentions. [See id.]\\\\n\\\\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states that, in order to be considered in\\\\nsupport or opposition to a motion, a declaration \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmust be made on personal\\\\nknowledge.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fed. R. CiV. P. 56(c)(4). It makes sense that a party cannot create a\\\\nfactual issue by having a Witness make a statement that is outside the scope of his\\\\npersonal knowledge, and the principle excluding such evidence is not a new one.\\\\nSee Cha\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82ee & Co. v. United States, 85 US. 516, 543 (1873). Accordingly, a\\\\n\\\\ndeclaration that a Witness \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbelieves\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d a fact to be true is typically insufficient to\\\\n\\\\ncreate a genuine issue as to the existence of that fact. See Pace v. Capobianco,\\\\n\\\\n283 F.3d 1275, 1278\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9479 (11th Cir. 2002).\\\\n\\\\n15Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 16 of 45\\\\n\\\\nThe declaration, in order to be considered, also must \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cset out facts that\\\\nwould be admissible in evidence.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fed. R. CiV. P. 56(c)(4). Through the Federal\\\\nRules of Evidence, the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpersonal knowledge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d requirement extends to lay opinion\\\\ntestimony. For non-expert Witnesses, testimony in the form of an opinion is\\\\nlimited to opinions \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9crationally based on the witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perception.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fed. R. EVid.\\\\n701(a). The advisory notes to Rule 701 state that subsection (a) codified \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe\\\\nfamiliar requirement of first\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94hand knowledge of observation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fed. R. EVid. 701,\\\\nadvisory committee notes, 1972 proposed rules. Rule 701 also requires that lay\\\\nopinion testimony be \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chelpful to clearly understanding the witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s testimony or\\\\nto determining a fact in issue.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fed. R. EVid. 701(b).\\\\n\\\\nAs cited by Kindred, the Second Circuit has held that opinion testimony\\\\nabout the motivation for an adverse employment action is inadmissible under\\\\nRule 701(b), because the witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s opinion Will not be helpful, and the jury can\\\\nreach its own conclusions about the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motivations. Hester v. Bic Corp,\\\\n225 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000). Hester was based only on Rule 701(b) because\\\\nthe parties disclaimed a Rule 701(a) argument. See id. at 181. Applying the\\\\nHester holding to its fullest extent may contradict Rule 704, Which states that\\\\n\\\\nopinion testimony is not \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[a]utomatica11y . . . objectionable just because it\\\\n\\\\n16Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 17 of 45\\\\n\\\\nembraces an ultimate issue.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fed. R. EVid. 704. Nevertheless, the underlying\\\\nprinciple remains that a witness may not offer a wholly conclusory opinion\\\\nwithout demonstrating that it is based on personal observations. Cf. Carter 12.\\\\nDecisionOne Corp., 122 F.3d 997, 1005 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that it was not\\\\nplain error to admit testimony regarding an employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s animus where the\\\\nwitnesses offered their opinions at the conclusion of their testimony and the\\\\nopinion was based on their perceptions).\\\\n\\\\nIn light of the governing rules and principles, portions of Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ndeclaration are inadmissible. I find paragraphs 1 through 6, t0 the extent\\\\nprobative, to be properly admissible. The opinions contained in these paragraphs\\\\nthat Willocks was an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cexcellent employee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and that Carter should have been\\\\nwritten up for her verbal altercation with Willocks are based on Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s factual\\\\ndeclarations that he was Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s direct supervisor and that he witnessed the\\\\nverbal altercation, respectively. [Doc. 38-2 M 1-6.] Likewise, paragraphs 8, 11,\\\\n13, and 15, with the exception of Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s conclusion that Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s high\\\\nblood pressure was based on work-related stress, are admissible as based on\\\\n\\\\nobservations plausibly within the witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s personal knowledge. [See doc. 38-2.]\\\\n\\\\n17Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 18 of 45\\\\n\\\\nThe remaining paragraphs of Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration, however, are not\\\\nadmissible. In paragraphs 7, 9, and 10, Thigpen offers a conclusion, in different\\\\nphrasing, that Hoffmann discriminated against older employees. The additional\\\\nstatement in paragraph 9 that Hoffmann \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgot her orders from the Headquarters in\\\\nFlorida\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is unsupported by any statement that would suggest how such a fact\\\\ncould be within Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s personal knowledge (or, for that matter, what it\\\\nactually means). Paragraph 14 similarly offers an unsupported conclusion that\\\\nKindred, as an institution, discriminated against Willocks because of a race,\\\\naccent, and national origin. The fact that paragraph 14\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s opinion is purportedly\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[b]ased on [Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s] observations,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and Thigpen generally stated in paragraph\\\\n2 that he has \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpersonal knowledge of the facts set forth in this Declaration\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is not\\\\nsufficient to support Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s conclusory opinions about the motivations of\\\\nothers. See Pace, 283 F.3d at 1279.\\\\n\\\\nIt should be noted that Thigpen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration is not the only one in this case\\\\nthat contains information beyond the scope of the witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s personal knowledge.\\\\nFor example, Schimtt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s declaration contains descriptions of events that he was not\\\\npresent for. [See Doc. 36-4 HI 9, 13.] I will not go through each declaration here\\\\n\\\\nto exclude evidence that was not objected to. But, I also will not rely on any\\\\n\\\\n18Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 19 of 45\\\\n\\\\npiece of evidence that is blatantly outside of the personal knowledge of the\\\\nwitness.\\\\nIV.

It is a basic principle of summary judgment that reasonable factual\\\\ninferences should be made in favor of the nonmovant. See Tolan, 134 S.Ct. at\\\\n1868. Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only argument that Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s testimony is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso lacking in\\\\ncredibility\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d that it would be unreasonable to believe it is the implication that the\\\\nPlaintiff cannot credibly offer testimony that is in her favor. [See Doc. 36-1 at 4-\\\\n5.] Such an argument is contradicted by binding case law and basic principles of\\\\njustice. See Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.\\\\n2013) (self\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94serving statements are admissible and can be sufficient to create an\\\\nissue of fact so long as they are based on personal knowledge).

But, for\\\\npurposes of this summary judgment motion, it is accepted as true (not arguendo)\\\\nthat Hoffmann told Willocks that she wanted to get rid of employees that were\\\\nolder than Hoffmann. [See Doc. 36-2 at 7-8.]\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, Hoffmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statements do not amount to direct evidence that\\\\n\\\\nKindred fired Willocks because of her age.

(quotation omitted).

However, the statement is not connected to the\\\\n\\\\n25Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 26 of 45\\\\n\\\\nadverse employment action complained of here. Hoffmann made the statement to\\\\nWillocks in the context of potentially terminating other employees. Willocks was\\\\nnot fired until at least a year after Hoffmann left the company. There is no\\\\nevidence beyond mere conjecture that would impute Hoffmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statement onto\\\\nothers at Kindred. In short, even allowing for reasonable inferences, it would be\\\\nunreasonable to conclude that Hoffmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statement, as re\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82ective as it may be\\\\nthat Hoffmann harbored a discriminatory animus when she said it, bears any\\\\ndirect relationship to Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s firing.

The only evidence regarding other employees is Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s testimony\\\\nregarding the three employees that she believed Hoffmann had targeted for firing.\\\\nThe evidence suggests, however, that those employees were older and were not\\\\nfired. Accordingly, Willocks cannot state a prima facie case under the ADEA,\\\\nbecause she has not identified or presented evidence of a single plausible\\\\ncomparator.

[Doc. 36-8 M\\\\n72-73.] Further, there is no evidence in the record that Willocks was substantially\\\\nlimited in any other activity outside of work. Accordingly, I find that there is not\\\\na triable issue of fact as to whether Willocks was disabled.

[See Doc. 36-1 at 18-19; Doc. 38 at 7-8.] For the same reasons discussed\\\\n\\\\nabove, therefore, I conclude that there is no direct evidence of race discrimination.\\\\n\\\\n35Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 36 of 45\\\\n\\\\n2. Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case under Title\\\\nVII 0r \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 1981 based on any protected characteristic\\\\nbecause, again, there is no evidence of a comparator who\\\\n\\\\nwas treated more favorably.\\\\nThe elements of a Claim for employment discrimination are the same under\\\\nTitle VII as they are under 42 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 1981. Stallworth v. Shuler, 777 F.2d 1431,\\\\n1433 (11th Cir. 1985). The prima facie elements of a racial discrimination claim\\\\nare: (1) the plaintiff belongs to a protected class; (2) plaintiff was qualified for the\\\\njob; (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) the\\\\nemployer treated plaintiff less favorably than similarly situated persons outside of\\\\nplaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s protected class. Crawford 12. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.\\\\n\\\\n2008).\\\\n\\\\nKindred broadly argues that Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case\\\\nof discrimination because she cannot establish a causal connection between her\\\\ntermination and a protected characteristic. [Doc. 36-1 at 18-19.] The entire\\\\n\\\\npurpose of the prima facie requirement under McDonnell Douglas is that it\\\\n\\\\ncreates a presumption of causation because direct evidence is often missing. See\\\\n\\\\nCombs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1537 (11th Cir. 1997), citing Price\\\\nWaterhouse 12.

The substance of Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s argument is better suited for an argument\\\\nthat Willocks is unable to show pretext.\\\\n\\\\nDespite Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s misplaced argument, Willocks still cannot make out a\\\\nprima facie case. Just as With the ADEA claim, there is no evidence of a\\\\ncomparator of any protected group different from Willocks Who was treated more\\\\nfavorably than Willocks. The only evidence in the record concerning other\\\\npotentially similarly situated Kindred employees involves individuals Who were\\\\nof the same purported race as Willocks. There is no information in the record\\\\nabout the national origin of those employees. Without any evidence of a similarly\\\\nsituated comparator, Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case of race\\\\ndiscrimination based on circumstantial evidence.\\\\n\\\\nF.

Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s testimony that she warned\\\\nher fellow co-workers to be careful is likely insufficient. Moreover, the\\\\nanonymous tip line complaint, With zero evidence in the record that Willocks\\\\n\\\\nmade that complaint, is also insufficient.\\\\n\\\\n9 Because this analysis involves interpretation of the specific language in\\\\nTitle VII, I am not sure Whether the same standards would apply to the \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 1981\\\\nretaliation claim. I need not reach that issue, however, because there is no reason\\\\nthat the analysis regarding the causation issue would not apply to the \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 1981\\\\nclaim.\\\\n\\\\n39Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 40 of 45\\\\n\\\\nReading the evidence most favorably to Willocks, however, she may have\\\\nopposed Hoffmann simply by not writing up the employees as directed by\\\\nHoffmann. [See Doc. 36-8 M 61-62.] It may be problematic for Willocks,\\\\nhowever, that Hoffmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s directive seems to have been more explicitly\\\\ndiscriminatory 0n the basis of age, not race, and Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s retaliation Claim is\\\\nasserted under Title VII. I Will not decide if that nuance is dispositive, however,\\\\nbecause, even assuming that Willocks opposed an unlawful employment practice\\\\nfor Title VII purposes, I readily conclude that Willocks cannot state a prima facie\\\\ncase because she cannot show a causal connection between an adverse\\\\nemployment action and protected activity.\\\\n\\\\n2.

[Id. HI 7.]\\\\n\\\\nA. Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Conversation and Interactions with Sally Hoffmann\\\\n\\\\nIn June 2011 or May 2012,2 interim CEO Sally Hoffmann told Willocks\\\\nthat she wanted her to write up older, Hispanic employees in order to get them\\\\nfired. [Doc. 36-8 HI 55, 58.] Willocks believed that Hoffmann wanted to get rid\\\\nof those employees because newer employees would be paid less and because\\\\nolder employees would be eligible for Social Security if fired. [Id. M 61-62.]\\\\nRegarding that conversation, Willocks testified \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[Hoffmann] said to me, we need\\\\nto cut staff. We need to only have four employees here daily.

[Doc. 36-1 at 23-24.] Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statement of the\\\\nlaw is not precisely correct. The law states that the two events must be \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cvery\\\\nclose\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in time in order for a plaintiff to rely on temporal proximity alone to\\\\nestablish a causal link. See Brown v. Ala. Dep\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t of Transp., 597 F.3d 1160, 1182\\\\n(11th Cir. 2010), citing Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273\\\\n(2001). A plaintiff can still show causation Where there is not close temporal\\\\nproximity, but she needs to point to other evidence suggestive of causation. Id.\\\\n\\\\nWillocks appears to concede that the temporal gap between her possible\\\\nopposition and her firing is too long to be sufficient on its own. [See Doc. 38 at\\\\n10.] Even if not conceded, I readily conclude that the gap is too long. This\\\\nCircuit has drawn the line on the sufficiency of temporal proximity alone at\\\\nsomewhere between seven weeks and three months. See Brown, 597 F.3d at\\\\n1182; Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. C0., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999).\\\\nThe gap here was over a year. Moreover, there was an intervening change in\\\\n\\\\ncorporate leadership.\\\\n\\\\n41Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 42 of 45\\\\n\\\\nWillocks argues that the termination is sufficiently close \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cconsidering how\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\nclearly the two square.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I really am not sure what Willocks means by this\\\\nargument. To the extent Willocks is arguing that her firing was re\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82ective of\\\\nHoffmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s previously stated desire to fire older employees, such an argument\\\\nwould undermine a claim that a retaliatory animus motivated her firing.\\\\n\\\\nWillocks also argues that intervening retaliatory conduct creates a\\\\nsufficient causal link between her opposition to Hoffmann\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plan and her firing.\\\\n[Doc. 38 at 10.] But Willocks argues that each of these events occurred shortly\\\\nafter her opposition. [Id.] While that may permit a finding that some of the\\\\nintermediate conduct was retaliatory, the only alleged adverse employment action\\\\nis Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s firing. All of the alleged intermediary treatment appears to have\\\\nbeen at the hands of Hoffmann, who left the company long before Willocks was\\\\nfired. [See id.; Doc. 38-3 M 13-15.] Accordingly, even if the intermediary\\\\nconduct were clearly retaliatory, that conduct occurred too long before Willocks\\\\nwas fired to create an inference that Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eventual termination was the\\\\nresult of retaliation. Moreover, as Kindred points out, short of assertions of a\\\\n\\\\nconspiracy, there is no evidence in the record that anyone employed by Kindred\\\\n\\\\nat the time of Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s firing was even aware of Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s possible opposition\\\\n\\\\n42Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 43 of 45\\\\n\\\\nt0 Hoffmann. In sum, Willocks cannot meet the causation prong 0f the prima\\\\nfacie case, and Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s retaliation\\\\nclaims as well.\\\\n\\\\nG. A brief discussion of pretext.\\\\n\\\\nI am recommending a conclusion that Willocks has not made out a prima\\\\nfacie case on any of her claims. It is therefore unnecessary to reach the parties\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\narguments about whether the evidence could show that Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stated reasons\\\\nfor firing Willocks were pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Nevertheless,\\\\ngiven the advisory function of this report, I will brie\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82y address the parties\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\narguments on that issue.\\\\n\\\\nKindred asserts that its legitimate non-discriminatory reason for firing\\\\nWillocks was that she falsified documents for use in a state audit and that she\\\\nprovided the documents directly to the state auditor despite being instructed by a\\\\nsupervisor to not do that. [D0c. 36-1 at 9.] This is sufficient to meet Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nlight burden at this stage. See Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1087. The inquiry next turns\\\\nto whether Willocks can point to sufficient evidence that could demonstrate that\\\\nKindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stated reasons were mere pretext for discrimination. Willocks cannot\\\\n\\\\nmeet that burden.\\\\n\\\\n43Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 44 of 45\\\\n\\\\nWillocks does not really dispute the factual underpinnings of Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nproffered reasoning. Specifically, Willocks concedes that she input the old data\\\\nonto a new form and that she gave some paperwork directly to the state auditor.\\\\n[See Doc. 38 at 4-5; Doc. 36-8 HI 41.] Willocks disputes the conclusions that\\\\nKindred reached based on those facts. She argues that the transfer of data from\\\\none form to another does not amount to forgery 0r falsification, and that she was\\\\nunderstandably acting at the direction of the auditor when she gave the auditor the\\\\nrequested documents. [See Doc. 38 at 4-7.]\\\\n\\\\nA plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\n\\\\nproffered reasons for an adverse employment action are \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cunworthy of credence.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSee Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 US. 133, 143 (2000)\\\\n(quotation omitted). Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dispute with Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interpretation of her\\\\nactions does not rise to that level. In essence, Willocks argues that she acted\\\\nreasonably, and therefore did not deserve to be fired. [See Doc. 38 at 5 (arguing\\\\nthat her transferring of data was less severe than a true forgery and that she may\\\\nhave had a duty to follow the auditor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instruction).] Willocks argues that it\\\\nshould be a question for the jury whether her actions warranted her firing. But,\\\\n\\\\nthe Court\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (and the jury\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s) role in discrimination cases is to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cprevent unlawful\\\\n\\\\n44Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 45 of 45\\\\n\\\\n[employment] practices, not to act as a super personnel department that second-\\\\nguesses employers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 business judgments.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d See Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1092. The\\\\nCourt in Wilson made clear that the plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arguments that the defendant erred\\\\nin judgment in finding her to be insubordinate was insufficient to establish a\\\\ndiscriminatory animus. Here, even accepting Willocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s contention that her\\\\ntransgressions were not as severe as Kindred asserts, she has not and cannot point\\\\nto evidence in the record that Kindred acted out of a discriminatory or a\\\\nretaliatory animus of any kind, or that Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stated reasons for firing her were\\\\nso far from the truth that it would suggest that Kindred was lying. Accordingly,\\\\neven if Willocks could make out a prima facie case on any of her claims, she\\\\nwould not be able to demonstrate that Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stated reasons for firing her were\\\\npretext for discrimination or retaliation.\\\\n\\\\nV.

Therefore, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 636(b)(1) and\\\\nRule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court has reviewed the\\\\nMagistrate Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Recommendation for Clear error as to those claims and \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81nds\\\\nnone. The Court therefore AD OPTS those portions of the R&R as the opinion of\\\\nthe Court.\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff does object to the dismissal of her Age Discrimination in\\\\nEmployment Act (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cADEA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d) claim and her retaliation claim under Title VII and \\\\xc2\\\\xa7\\\\n1981.

The Court \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81nds that the Magistrate Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s R&R is largely\\\\ncorrect and therefore OVERRULES Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Objections.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, Plaintiff objects that the R&R erred when it concluded that Sally\\\\nHoffman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statements to Plaintiff in 2011 asking Plaintiff to help Hoffman \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81re\\\\nolder works are direct evidence that Plaintiff was discriminated against on the\\\\nbasis of age when she was terminated in 2013.

Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scheme to\\\\nterminate Plaintif .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Objs. at 2.) But\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[d]irect evidence is evidence that\\\\nestablishes the existence of discriminatory intent behind the employment\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\ndecision without any inference or presumption.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Tiggs-Vaughn v.

Because \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 as Plaintiff\\\\n\\\\nconcedes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the Court would have to infer the existence of scheme to terminateCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 47 Filed 06/28/17 Page 4 of 5\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff in 2013 from Hoffman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statements made in 2011, those statements are\\\\nnot direct evidence of discrimination. The R&R also correctly observes that\\\\ndiscriminatory statements that are distant in time from an adverse employment\\\\ndecision are generally not direct evidence. And Plaintiff does not provide\\\\nevidence connecting Hoffman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statements with that of other Kindred\\\\nmanagement level employees, like Carter (who was also involved in the events\\\\nsurroundin g Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 termin ation).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff also objects that she made out a prima facie case of\\\\ndiscrimination, and that the R&R erred when it concluded Plaintiff had failed to\\\\npoint to a comparator. Plaintiff objects that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cothers were treated more favorably\\\\nthan Plaintiff \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they were not terminated \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 while Plaintiff was terminated.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n(Objs. at 2.) But Plaintiff does not identify a single person by name, and does not\\\\nshow how they are in fact appropriate comparators by addressing whether or not\\\\nthey were similarly situated.\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff next objects that she did create a genuine issue of fact as to\\\\nwhether her opposition to Hoffman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s and Kindred\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s alleged scheme to terminate\\\\nolder employees was causally connected to her own termination. But the record\\\\nshows that Hoffman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statements and the alleged campaign of harassment\\\\nagainst Plaintiff all occurred long before Plaintiff was \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81red. And as the R&R\\\\nobserves, Hoffman stepped down as CEO and new management took her place.\\\\n\\\\nThe gap between Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s opposition and her eventual termination is too lon g toCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404446\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94AT Document 47 Filed 06/28/17 Page 5 of 5\\\\n\\\\nsustain her claim. Finally, the Court agrees that Plaintiff cannot show pretext for\\\\nthe reasons identified in the R&R.\\\\n\\\\nThe Court acknowledges that Plaintiff was a 22-year veteran at Kindred.\\\\nIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s more than possible that Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s termination was unfair, given her many\\\\nyears of service.

E doc. 45-1 at 2 1] 3 (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d1400 derives\\\\nrevenues from fees paid by customers on two ATMs in Swinging Richards, one\\\\nof which uses the phone lines and the other of which uses an Internet\\\\nconnection.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d).\\\\n\\\\nParagraph 84 states that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dPlaintiffs receive no wages for their dancing\\\\nwork at Swinging Richards.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Doc. 45-1 at 14. Defendants disagree, stating that\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dhouse-set, minimum charges for table dances and VIP Room Visits count as\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dwages[,]\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [] not \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dtips[,]\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [] per the IRS and Department of Labor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Doc. 52-16 at\\\\n3. That, however, is a legal conclusion that fails to qualify as a valid objection\\\\nunder L.R. 561(3) (2) (a) (2) Still, Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dfact\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d itself contains hints of\\\\nconclusion. Whether Defendants paid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dwages\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is in some sense the ultimate\\\\nissue in this litigation. To the extent paragraph 84 refers to that issue, then, it is\\\\nnot deemed admitted. Insofar as it Plaintiffs meant that they do not receive any\\\\n\\\\nmoney directly from Defendants (i.e., that they received money only from\\\\n\\\\nA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 5 of 23\\\\n\\\\ncustomers), that fact is admitted.\\\\n\\\\nParagraphs 85-87 relate to Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 knowledge of a previous FLSA\\\\nlawsuit against the same defendants as in this case, and of their ability to opt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in\\\\nto its settlement. Doc. 45-1 at 14-15. Defendants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 object that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d[w]hat plaintiffs\\\\nknew cannot be determined without a thorough testing and examination of their\\\\ncredibility.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Doc. 52-16 at 3. But that is not a L.R. 56.1-compliant objection\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it\\\\ndoes not directly refute Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 proferred fact, it does not object to\\\\nadmissibility, and it does not highlight a lack of evidentiary support. The Court\\\\ntherefore deems paragraphs 85-87 admitted.\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Statement of Undisputed Fact, all of which the Court deems\\\\nadmitted, forms the basis for what follows.\\\\n\\\\nII. BACKGROUND\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dSwinging Richards is a nightclub featuring nude male dancers in Atlanta,\\\\nGeorgia, which is owned and operated by Defendant 1400 Northside Drive, Inc.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDoc. 45-1 at 1 (Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Statement of Material Fact). 1400 is itself owned by\\\\ndefendant CB. Jones, who also owns the property on which the club sits. Li. at\\\\n\\\\n9. Plaintiffs Zachary Chastain and Travis Delduca are former male strippers who\\\\n\\\\nworked at the club from 2013 until late-2016 (October for Delduca, December for\\\\n\\\\nA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 6 of 23\\\\n\\\\nChastain). Li. at 3. Wilson, who began dancing at the club in 2013, remains\\\\nemployed by 1400. Li. at 3.\\\\n\\\\n1400 classifies its dancers as independent contractors and compensates\\\\nthem exclusively through customer tips. Doc. 45-1 at 14. It does not, however,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dkeep records of payments made to dancers by customers for performances on\\\\nstage . . . [or] for table\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94side dances.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Li. at 10. Cash from VIP room customers\\\\nstays in an envelope with the VIP doorman \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9duntil the end of the night, at which\\\\ntime the dancer collects it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Li. at 11. 1400 issues checks to dancers twenty-four\\\\nhours after a VIP roomcustomer pays with a credit card.\\\\n\\\\nIn March 2014, 1400 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dbegan having dancers fill out timesheets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Doc. 45-1\\\\nat 11. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [T]hose timesheets contain[ed] dancers\\\\\\' time in and out, total VIP rooms,\\\\nand total tips, but not the actual amount earned from VIP dances.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d 1400\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\naccountant then filed those timesheets, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dand did nothing else with them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Li.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dAt some point . . . Defendants began having the VIP manager track the\\\\namounts of money dancers received in cash for VIP dances\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d by giving the dancer\\\\na receipt. Doc. 45-1 at 13. That manager never entered the total cash received\\\\n\\\\namount into \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dhis computer spreadsheet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Li. The receipts were \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dperiodically\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nsent to 1400\\\\\\'s accountant, but he \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dsimply put them in a box\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he did not use the\\\\n\\\\nA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 7 of 23\\\\n\\\\nreceipts to calculate revenues for tax return purposes. Li. Instead, the\\\\naccountant \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dextrapolated the dancers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 minimum VIP fees based on the length of\\\\nthe room rentals recorded on the VIP manager\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spreadsheet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Li. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dOn a\\\\nmonth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94to-month basis, the club did nothing to account for the dancers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 VIP fees.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nLi. Dancers now must write \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dtheir total cash received on the back of their\\\\ntimecards, [but] Swinging Richards does nothing with that information for\\\\naccounting purposes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Li. at 14.\\\\nIII. ANALYSIS\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiffs seek summary judgment on seven discreet issues: (1) whether\\\\nPlaintiffs were employees or independent contractors; (2) whether 1400 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dis an\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99enterprise engaged in commerce\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as that term is used in the FLSA and is subject\\\\nto the FLSA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minimum wage provisions;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (3) whether \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dJones is a joint\\\\nemployer;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (4) whether \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dPlaintiffs are not exempt \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99creative professionals;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (5)\\\\nwhether VIP room and table dance fees qualified as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dservice charges\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d that offset\\\\nDefendants minimum wage obligations; (6) whether Plaintiffs can obtain\\\\n$7.25/ hr in back wages \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dfor each hour worked in the statutory limitations period,\\\\nin addition to reimbursement of all fees and fines paid;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and (7) whether\\\\n\\\\nDefendants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 breach of contract and unjust enrichment counterclaims fail. Doc.A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 8 of 23\\\\n\\\\n45-5 at 30-31. They also contend that two orders in another FLSA case brought\\\\nby Swinging Richards dancers should bar relitigation of issue one, and issues\\\\nthree through seven. Li. at 5. Before delving into all that, however, a Local Rule\\\\nrequires the Court to address Defendants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 summary judgment response.\\\\n\\\\nLocal Rule 7.1 (B) makes clear that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d [f]ailure to file a response shall indicate\\\\nthat there is no opposition to the motion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And defendants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 response \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dbrief\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n(doc. 52) as discussed in a previous Order (doc. 57), lacks much substance. For\\\\nexample, in addressing issue one (enterprise liability), it states in its unedited\\\\nentirety: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d[s]ee, discussion in the comments and annotations of the 11th Circuit\\\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Exhibits 1 and 2. Clearly, these\\\\ndeterminations involve questions of law for a jury to decide.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Doc. 52.\\\\n\\\\nAs made clear in its previous Order, the Court will not sift through cited\\\\nbut unargued legal authorities, briefs from other cases, and other documents\\\\nincorporated by reference. The Court will not manufacture arguments for\\\\nDefendants. In essence, responses like Defendants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 enterprise liability argument\\\\nare no response at all.\\\\n\\\\nIll\\\\n\\\\nDefendants creative professionals\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d defense, their response to Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\nproposed calculation of back pay, and their argument in favor of theirCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 9 of 23\\\\n\\\\ncounterclaims contain similar flaws. Doc. 52 at 4-6. For each one, Defendants\\\\nbarely respond at all, and when they do, they simply refer the Court to case law\\\\nand briefing from another FLSA action involving 1400 and many of the same\\\\nissues. Li.\\\\n\\\\nStill, the Court discerns opposition from Defendants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 limited \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dresponses.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt therefore will not deem anything unopposed pursuant to L.R. 7.1(B), with the\\\\nexception of Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 employee/ independent contractor argument (Defendants\\\\nfail to address that issue at all). But Defendants did themselves no favors. The\\\\nsuccess or failure of Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 summary judgment motion on the issues to which\\\\nDefendants barely respond thus rises and falls with Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 arguments and\\\\n\\\\nfacts alone. But first, Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 collateral estoppel argument.\\\\n\\\\nA. Non\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Mutual Offensive Collateral Estoppel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dOffensive, nonmutual collateral estoppel is a doctrine under which a\\\\nplaintiff asserts that a defendant is barred from litigating an issue based on a\\\\ndecision rendered in a case in which the plaintiff was not involved.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Demaree\\\\nV. Fulton Cty. Sch. Dist., 515 F. App\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Parklane\\\\nHosiery Co. V. Shore, 439 US. 322, 327\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9428 (1979)). \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dIn order for nonmutual\\\\n\\\\ncollateral estoppel to apply, the issue currently before the Court (1) must be\\\\n\\\\nA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 10 of 23\\\\n\\\\nidentical to the one alleged in the prior litigation; (2) the issue must have been\\\\nactually litigated; and (3) the determination in the prior proceeding must have\\\\n\\\\nbeen a crucial and necessary part of the judgment in the earlier action.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Berry V.\\\\n\\\\nGreat Am.

Connors, 829 F.2d 1577, 1580 (11th\\\\nCir.1987)).\\\\n\\\\nAs mentioned, this is not 1400\\\\\\'s first litigation rodeo. In Henderson V. 1400\\\\nNorthside Drive \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a case brought by male strippers alleging the same minimum\\\\nwage claims Plaintiffs here assert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this Court held that 1400 suffered enterprise\\\\nliability under the FLSA because (1) it had gross annual sales \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9din excess of\\\\n$500,000,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and (2) it engaged in commerce by selling customers alcohol that it\\\\nobtained \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dfrom outside of Georgia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d 2016 WL 3125012, at *2 (ND. Ga. June 3,\\\\n2016). It also held that Jones incurred individual liability because he wielded\\\\nenough control over 1400 to qualify as an employer. Li. at *3. In a separate\\\\nOrder, the Court rejected 1400\\\\\\'s creative professional defense because the\\\\n\\\\nstrippers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dancing did not reflect a sufficiently high degree of creativity.\\\\n\\\\nHenderson V. 1400 Northside Drive Inc. 110 F.

Sutton, brings this Complaint against Hennecold Storage,\\\\n\\\\nInc., and shows the Court as follows:\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION\\\\n\\\\n1.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a case brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act.Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404486\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 2 of 25\\\\n\\\\n2.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to his federal causes of action, Plaintiff asserts pendent state law\\\\nclaims Which arise out of the same set of operating facts as his federal claims.\\\\nThese are (l) breach of contract, (2) quantum meruit and (3) promissory estoppel.\\\\n\\\\n3.\\\\n\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold systematically truncated its\\\\ncompensation of Sutton--as well as its compensation of all similarly situated\\\\nemployees that Sutton seeks to represent\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94by failing to correctly convert the hours\\\\nand minutes its employees worked into proper digital values for pay purposes.\\\\nHennecold\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s improper calculation resulted in every hourly employee being paid less\\\\nthan the amount earned for every week worked by such employees.\\\\n\\\\n4.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to this claim of pay truncation, Sutton brings his own claims for l)\\\\nimproper deduction of thirty minutes each day for a break When the company knew\\\\nor should have known that he often did not take such a break; and 2) his\\\\n\\\\nmisclassi\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81cation as exempt during certain periods of his employment.Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 11 of 25\\\\n\\\\n42.\\\\nDuring the maj ority of Sutton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work time, he operated equipment and worked\\\\nalongside Hennecold\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s laborers to move merchandise Within Hennecold\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nwarehouse.\\\\n\\\\n43.\\\\n\\\\nSutton did not interview potential new employees for Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\n44.\\\\n\\\\nSutton did not make recommendations regarding candidates for employment\\\\nWith Hennecold that Hennecold afforded any particular weight.\\\\n45.\\\\nSutton did not have the authority to hire employees for Hennecold.\\\\n46.\\\\nSutton did not train employees for Hennecold.\\\\n47.\\\\nSutton did not set or adjust the pay rates of employees for Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\n48.\\\\n\\\\nSutton did not set or adjust the work hours of employees for Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\n11Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404486\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 12 of 25\\\\n\\\\n49.\\\\nSutton did not maintain the production or sales records for use in supervision or\\\\ncontrol of employees for Hennecold.\\\\n50.\\\\nSutton did not handle complaints and grievances of employees for Hennecold.\\\\n5 1.\\\\nSutton did not determine discipline employees for Hennecold.\\\\n52.\\\\nSutton recorded the quantities of materials utilized into Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tracking\\\\nsystem for upper management to track.\\\\n5 3.\\\\nSutton did not provide for the safety and security of the employees of\\\\nHennecold.\\\\n54.\\\\nSutton did not plan or control any budget for Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\n55.\\\\n\\\\nSutton did not monitor or implement legal compliance measures for Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\n12Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 13 of 25\\\\n\\\\n56.\\\\n\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Sutton did not have the authority to \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81re employees\\\\nfor Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\n57.\\\\n\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Sutton did not make recommendations regarding\\\\nhiring, \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ring, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other\\\\nemployees to Which Hennecold attached particular weight.\\\\n\\\\n58.\\\\n\\\\nDespite not having the primary duty of exempt work, Sutton was misolassi\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ed\\\\n\\\\nas exempt during portions of his employment With Hennecold.\\\\n\\\\nImproper Deduction for Breaks\\\\n\\\\n5 9.\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold auto-deduoted thirty minutes from each\\\\nof Sutton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work days.\\\\n60.\\\\nHennecold knew, or should have known in the exercise of reasonable\\\\nmanagement practices, that Sutton did not take lunch or other break approximately\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81fty percent of the time.\\\\n\\\\n13Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 14 of 25\\\\n\\\\n61.\\\\nAs a result of this auto-deduction, Sutton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pay was reduced below that agreed\\\\n\\\\nupon and, in certain weeks, resulted in a reduction of the overtime pay required.\\\\n\\\\nImproper Pay Computation Allegations\\\\n62.\\\\n\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold recorded the work time of Sutton and\\\\n\\\\nall similarly situated warehouse workers.\\\\n63.\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Employee Time Records expressed\\\\neach employee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work time in hours and minutes divided by a colon.\\\\n64.\\\\n\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold regularly and systematically truncated\\\\nthe compensation it paid Sutton and all similarly situated warehouse workers by\\\\nfailing to properly convert such horological values into correct digital values (i.e.,\\\\ntime expressed by hours and hundredths of an hour and divided by a decimal point)\\\\nfor pay purposes.\\\\n\\\\n65.\\\\nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold regularly and systematically improperly\\\\n\\\\nconverted such horological values into incorrect digital values by substituting a\\\\n\\\\n14Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 15 of 25\\\\n\\\\ndecimal point for the colon and by no further adjustment to account for the\\\\ndifference between minutes (i.e., by sixtieths of an hour) and the hundredths of an\\\\n\\\\nhour used in a digital value.\\\\n\\\\n66.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, during the week that ended August 28, 2013, Sutton (Without\\\\ntaking into account the auto-deduction for a break) worked for Hennecold a total of\\\\n\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81fty-six hours and thirty-nine minutes (i.e., a horological value that is expressed as\\\\n56:39).\\\\n\\\\n67.\\\\nThe horological value expressed as 56:39 is equivalent to the digital value of\\\\n\\\\n56.65 hours.\\\\n\\\\n68.\\\\n\\\\nHennecold converted the horological value of Sutton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work time for the week\\\\nending on August 28, 2013 by merely replacing the colon of the horological value\\\\nWith a decimal, resulting in the incorrect digital value of 56.39 hours/minutes in\\\\nlieu of the correct value of 5 6.65 hours.\\\\n\\\\n69.\\\\nAn employee Who is not exempt from the FLSA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overtime requirements and\\\\n\\\\nWho works 56 hours and 39 minutes for his employer in a workweek should be\\\\n\\\\n15Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 16 of 25\\\\n\\\\ncompensated by such employer for 40.0 hours at his regular rate and for an\\\\n\\\\nadditional 16.65 hours at an overtime rate equivalent to one and one half of his\\\\n\\\\nregular rate.\\\\n\\\\n70.\\\\nHennecold paid Sutton for the work he performed in the week ending August\\\\n28, 2013 at his regular rate for 40.0 hours and at his overtime rate for 16.39 hours.\\\\n7 1 .\\\\nHennecold thus truncated Sutton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pay for the work he performed in the week\\\\nending August 28, 2013 by .26 hours at his overtime rate.\\\\n72.\\\\nBy way of further example, during the week that ended September 4, 2013,\\\\nSutton worked for Hennecold a total of \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81fty-\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ve hours and \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81fty-six minutes (i.e., a\\\\n\\\\nhorological value expressed as 55:56).\\\\n\\\\n73.\\\\nThe horological value expressed as 55:56 is equivalent to the digital value of\\\\n\\\\n55.93 hours.\\\\n\\\\n16Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 17 of 25\\\\n\\\\n74.\\\\nAn employee Who is not exempt from the FLSA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overtime requirements and\\\\n\\\\nWho works 55:56 for his employer in a workweek should be paid for 40.0 hours at\\\\n\\\\nhis regular rate and for 15.93 hours at his overtime rate.\\\\n75.\\\\n\\\\nHennecold paid Sutton for the work he performed in the week ending\\\\nSeptember 4, 2013 at his regular rate for 40.0 hours and at his overtime rate for\\\\n15 .56 hours.\\\\n\\\\n76.\\\\n\\\\nIn doing so, Hennecold truncated Sutton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s compensation for the work he\\\\nperformed in the week ending September 4, by the value of .37 hours at his\\\\novertime rate.\\\\n\\\\n77.\\\\n\\\\nDuring each week Within the three years immediately preceding this action,\\\\n\\\\nHennecold repeated this pattern of improper compensation calculation for Sutton\\\\n\\\\nand all similarly situated employees.\\\\n\\\\n17Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 18 of 25\\\\n\\\\nCOUNT I - FAILURE TO PAY OVERTIME\\\\n\\\\n78.\\\\n\\\\nThe

In October 2013, Mr. Hassan learned that his wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pregnancy had\\\\ncomplications and that she would require cardiologic care.\\\\n\\\\n16. Consequently, on October 30, 2013, Mr. Hassan notified his\\\\nsupervisor, Wes Newsome, General Manager of Camping World in Woodstock,\\\\nGeorgia, that he would need to take leave to provide for her care.\\\\n\\\\n17. On November 5, 2013, Mr. Hassan submitted Camping World\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPersonnel Status Change Form\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to Tamiko Taylor, the local human resources\\\\nrepresentative, J oel Cline, Regional Vice President, and Newsome to request his\\\\naccrued paid time off (PTO) and \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82oating holidays (FH).\\\\n\\\\n18.

I should come back sooner but for now I\\\\n\\\\nwould like permission to use any and all PTO and FH\\\\navailable to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n19. Newsome and Cline refused to approve Mr. Hassan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s PTO and FH\\\\nrequest.\\\\n20.

Mr. Hassan ultimately was approved for continuous FMLA leave\\\\nbeginning November 11, 2013 through February 27, 2014.\\\\n\\\\n24. Not satisfied With denying Mr. Hassan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leave, Newsome harassed Mr.\\\\nHassan by email regarding When he would return to work.\\\\n\\\\n25. After Mr. Hassan requested FMLA leave, Mr. Newsome issued a\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDisciplinary Action\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to Mr. Hassan on November 9, 2013 on a form not otherwise\\\\nused by Camping World.\\\\n\\\\n26. Newsome listed the unsigned PTO request as a reason for the\\\\ndisciplinary action, even though Mr. Hassan submitted the form to Newsome by\\\\nemail following his Wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s emergency.\\\\n\\\\n27. Newsome also listed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[n]0t communicating With direct supervisor\\\\n\\\\nthroughout time away\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as a reason for the discipline, despite that Mr. HassanCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404498\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94WSD Document 1 Filed 12/30/15 Page 6 of 13\\\\n\\\\nemailed Newsome and other team members during his leave to ensure the\\\\ndepartment ran smoothly in his absence.\\\\n\\\\n28. Newsome also listed warranty issues that not only existed for years\\\\nbefore Mr. Hassan assumed the Service Manager position at Woodstock but also of\\\\nWhich Camping World was well aware before appointing Mr. Hassan as Service\\\\nManager of the Woodstock location.\\\\n\\\\n29. Newsome and Cline knew that Mr. Hassan had diligently worked to\\\\ncorrect the existing warranty issues and had previously told him that they knew he\\\\nhad not acted unethically regarding warranties.\\\\n\\\\n30. Warranty issues had persisted for seven years at the Woodstock\\\\nlocation, but only Mr. Hassan received \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdiscipline\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for those issues, and then, Mr.\\\\nHassan was disciplined only after he requested medical leave.\\\\n\\\\n31.

(Doc. 3, Complaint).\\\\nPlaintiff alleges in her Complaint that her former employer, the United States Postal\\\\nService (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUSPS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDefendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), unlawfully discriminated and retaliated against her\\\\non the basis of race (black) and seX (female), wrongfully terminated her, and subj ected\\\\nher to haras sment, in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,\\\\n42 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 2000e, et seq. (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTitle VII\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d).\\\\n\\\\nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s Motion for Summary Judgment\\\\n\\\\n(Doc. 35) and Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s Motion for an Extension of Time (Doc. 39) to file her responseA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv-04515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 2 of 39\\\\n\\\\nt0 Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment. Because Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion for an\\\\nextension and her summary judgment response were untimely filed, Defendant opposes\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion for an extension. (Doc. 41).\\\\n\\\\nFor the reasons stated below, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion for an extension (Doc. 39) is\\\\nGRANTED. I RECOMMEND that Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion for summary judgment\\\\n(Doc. 35) be GRANTED.\\\\n\\\\nI. PLAINTIFF\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S MOTION FOR AN EXTENSION\\\\n\\\\nAfter the extended discovery period in this matter closed, Defendant timely filed\\\\nits motion for summary judgment on J anuary 17, 2017. (Doc. 35). Pursuant to Local\\\\nRule 56.1 and this Court\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Scheduling Order issued on May 24, 2016 (Doc. 16),\\\\nPlaintiff had twenty-one days from the date Defendant served its motion for summary\\\\njudgment on her to file her response. LR 56.1, NDGa. On February 21, 2017, after\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s deadline for filing her response had passed, Plaintiff filed a two-and-a\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94half\\\\npage response opposing Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s motion for summary judgment (With 36 pages of\\\\nattachments), and a very short motion asking the Court\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 3 permission to extend the time\\\\n\\\\nfor filing her response \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[d]ue t0 the complexity of producing evidence and research.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n(Does. 39, 40).A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 11 of 39\\\\n\\\\nthat Ms. Gomez was making her re-do scans she had performed earlier in the day, which\\\\nmade her late with her pick-up twice in one week, and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmade it impossible for\\\\n[Plaintiff] to meet [her] dispatch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Doc. 38-1 at 23). Plaintiff stated that she was afraid\\\\nof losing her job, and she asked for Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s assistance in resolving her concerns.\\\\n\\\\nIn response, Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal sent Plaintiff a reply email stating that she had called\\\\nSherry Garrett regarding Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s concerns, and Garrett told O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal that she had just\\\\nspoken with Plaintiff and would speak with her again concerning the issues Plaintiff had\\\\nraised. (Doc. 40-2 at 17). Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal told Plaintiff that she hoped her issues would be\\\\nresolved, but if they were not, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next step was to speak directly with the\\\\nPostmaster. (I_d.). Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal closed by stating that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHR does not get involved in\\\\nsituations that can be resolved within the office.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (I_d.).\\\\n\\\\nFollowing Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s email to Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal, Plaintiff met the same day with her\\\\nunion steward, Will Stephens, and her direct supervisor, Sherry Garrett, about\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s work hours and overtime. Mr. Stephens informed Ms. Garrett that as a PSE,\\\\nPlaintiff was not permitted to work over 12 hours a day. (Moten Dep. at 85).\\\\n\\\\nMs. Garrett agreed to submit a request for an adjustment with regard to Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\n\\\\novertime hours. (Ld. at 84, 88, 109-10, 112-13; Doc. 38-1 at 20).\\\\n\\\\n11A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 12 of 39\\\\n\\\\nStarting on or about March 10, 2014, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work hours were significantly\\\\nreduced, and Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Saturday work schedule was changed to a split shift where\\\\nPlaintiff worked from 5:00 am. to 10:30 am, then she returned to work from 3:00 p.m.\\\\nto 6:00 p.m. (Doc. 38-1 at 14). After her work hours were reduced, Plaintiff\\\\ncomplained that she was being held accountable for performing her entire dispatch\\\\nworkload in half the time. (Id. at 8).\\\\n\\\\nDuring Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s period of employment at the Woodstock Post Office, Sherry\\\\nGarrett observed numerous deficiencies in Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s job performance. (DSMF HI 12).\\\\nAt an EEO hearing before an administrative judge on May 20, 2015, Ms. Garrett\\\\ntestified that Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s overall job performance was deficient in the following ways:\\\\n\\\\nThe Express Mail was left -- when you do dispatch, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s your\\\\nresponsibility to clean the area to make sure everything is\\\\ndispatched on the truck that night. So it doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t matter who\\\\ndoes dispatch, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re to make sure everything is on the\\\\ntruck. And so on several occasions, [Plaintiff] left Express\\\\nMail and it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get on the truck. It was more than one\\\\noccasion she left Express Mail. It was more overall\\\\nperformance. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t just an Express Mail.\\\\n\\\\nIt was her overall performance issue. Breaking down mail,\\\\nshe would break it down, then the next day she would come\\\\nback and ask how to separate classes of mail. Scanning, we\\\\nhad scanning issues on several occasions. She misscanned\\\\n260 packages one day. The next day she missed 200\\\\nmisscanning packages. She would make the truck late on\\\\n\\\\n12A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 13 of 39\\\\n\\\\nseveral occasions for the dispatch. So, you know, you want\\\\nto get the truck loaded and it gets to the plant so your mail\\\\ngets out timely. [A]nd complaining, she constantly\\\\ncomplained a lot about she was working too many hours or\\\\nnot enough hours or she was coming in too early or coming\\\\nin too late. So it was pretty much overall -- you know, all her\\\\nperformance...\\\\n\\\\n(Doc. 38-2 at 14-15, 17).\\\\n\\\\nOn March 18, 2014, Ms. Garrett issued Plaintiff a Letter of Warning for failure\\\\nto follow instructions. (Doc. 40-3 at 2). The letter stated that on March 15, 2014,\\\\nPlaintiff had mis-scanned packages \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cprepaid acceptance\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d instead of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9carrival at unit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nand Plaintiff had admitted doing so. (Li). The letter stated that as a result of Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\nfailure to scan packages properly, the Woodstock Post Office was placed on a non-\\\\ncompliant list. (Li). The letter warned that future deficiencies would result in more\\\\nsevere disciplinary action being taken against her, including suspensions, reduction in\\\\ngrade and/or pay, or removal from the Postal Service. The letter informed Plaintiff that\\\\nshe had a right to file a grievance under the grievance/arbitration procedure set forth in\\\\nArticle 15 of the National Agreement within 14 days of her receipt of the letter. (Li).\\\\nThe warning letter was later rescinded pursuant to a settlement agreement between\\\\n\\\\nSherry Garrett, on behalf of the USPS, and William Stephens, on behalf of the\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Postal Workers Union, due to noncompliance with Article 16 of the collective\\\\n\\\\n13A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 14 of 39\\\\n\\\\nbargaining agreement and the USPS-APWU J 0th Contract Interpretation Manual\\\\n\\\\n(\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJCIM\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d). (Doc. 40-3 at 1; Moten Dep. at 60).\\\\nOn March 19, 2014, Ms. Garrett spoke with Postmaster Ledford about Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\njob performance and possible termination. (Doc. 40-2 at 3, 9-10; Doc. 38-2 at 7-8).\\\\nOn March 21, 2014, Plaintiff sent another email to Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal. (Doc. 38-1 at\\\\n24). Plaintiff thanked her for the opportunity to work at the Woodstock Post Office,\\\\nsaid that she was relocating very soon to Atlanta, and asked if there were any transfer\\\\noptions available at that time or other positions that Plaintiff qualified for. Plaintiff\\\\n\\\\nclosed by stating that she would continue to check USPS listings daily. (Id.; Moten\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nDep. at 95).\\\\n\\\\nOn March 22, 2014, Plaintiff reported to work as scheduled. (Moten Dep. at 93).\\\\nAround 10:30 am, Sherry Garrett asked Plaintiff to report to Garrett\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s office, where\\\\nthey met with Ms. Donna Vaughn, a union steward for the rural carriers. (Doc. 38-1 at\\\\n21). Ms. Garrett commenced the meeting by telling Plaintiff that she (Garrett),\\\\nPostmaster Todd Ledford, and Ms. Loretta Gomez were unhappy with Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job\\\\nperformance. (Li). Ms. Garrett explained that on Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s first day of work, she had\\\\nleft an express mail package under her desk, and on March 19, 2014, another express\\\\n\\\\nmail package that she was responsible for was found in a bucket. (Li). Plaintiff denied\\\\n\\\\n14A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 15 of 39\\\\n\\\\nthat she had left any express mail packages. (Li). Ms. Garrett told Plaintiff that other\\\\nemployees had also complained about mail being left behind.\\\\n\\\\nMs. Garrett gave Plaintiff the option of resigning or being terminated. In her\\\\ndeposition, Plaintiff testified that she asked why she should resign. (Moten Dep. at 94).\\\\nDonna Vaughn, the union steward, told her that resigning would look better than\\\\ntermination, and it would allow Plaintiff to apply for other postal positions. (Doc. 38-1\\\\nat 21). Plaintiff asked to see the paperwork regarding her termination and her personnel\\\\nfolder, and was told by Ms. Garrett that they were not available and there was nothing\\\\nin her personnel file regarding the reasons why Plaintiff was being terminated. (Moten\\\\nDep. at 94; Doc. 38-1 at 21). Ms. Garrett then asked for Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s badge and told her\\\\nthat she was terminated. (Moten Dep. at 94; Doc. 38-1 at 21). Plaintiff clocked out and\\\\nwent home. (Moten Dep. at 94).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s OPF contains a letter dated March 22, 2014, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSUBJECT: Termination\\\\nof Employment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d stating as follows:\\\\n\\\\nThis is to advise you that you will be terminated during\\\\nprobation from your position of PSE at the Woodstock Post\\\\nOffice at the close of business on Saturday, March 22, 2014.\\\\n\\\\nUnder no circumstances should you work past this date.\\\\n\\\\nThis action is being taken due to Unsatisfactory Performance.\\\\n\\\\n15A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 16 of 39\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Postal inspectors will be notified if ID badges are not\\\\nreturned by March 26, 2014.\\\\n\\\\n(Doc. 38-1 at 27; DSMF HI 15). The letter is signed by \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSherry Garrett, [ ] Customer\\\\nService Supervisor, Woodstock, Ga. 30188.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Doc. 38-1 at 27). Plaintiff asserts that\\\\nshe did not receive a copy of her termination letter, however, until it was faxed to her\\\\non May 14, 2014. (Doc. 40, Pl.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Br. in Opp\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n, at 1; Doc. 40-2 at 4).\\\\n\\\\nOn Monday, March 24, 2014, Plaintiff sent an email to Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal informing\\\\nher that Plaintiff had been terminated over the weekend, and that the reason given for\\\\nterminating her was that her performance was not what the Postmaster and her\\\\nsupervisors were looking for. (Doc. 40-2 at 19). Plaintiff explained that Sherry Garrett\\\\nhad offered to allow Plaintiff to resign, but Plaintiff had declined, so Garrett terminated\\\\nher. Plaintiff noted that things had gotten \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpretty hostile\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d after her letter of concern\\\\n(i.e., Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s March 3, 2014 email to Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal) was received. Plaintiff stated,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know if this termination will hurt my chances of ever being employed [at] the\\\\nPost Office [but] [i]f I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m still eligible for re-hire I will continue to apply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Li).\\\\n\\\\nA few days later, Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal contacted Plaintiff and told her that there was a\\\\nposition available at the Crown Road facility, and she could find out more about it if\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff was interested. (Moten Dep. at 95). Plaintiff expressed an interest in returning\\\\n\\\\nto the USPS. (Ld. at 96). When Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal got back to Plaintiff with a more detailed\\\\n\\\\n16A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 17 of 39\\\\n\\\\nexplanation of what the job would involve, Plaintiff learned that she would be working\\\\nthe third shift at Crown Road, she would have to serve a new 90-day probationary\\\\nperiod, and Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal could not guarantee that Plaintiff would never be laid off for\\\\nlack of work like in the past. However, the position was immediately available, and Ms.\\\\nO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal offered to reassign Plaintiff to the Crown Road facility in lieu of termination.\\\\n\\\\n(Id.; Doc. 38-1 at 25). Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal told Plaintiff that under the reas signment, Plaintiff\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nwould retain her leave computation date and her NTE date would remain J anuary 6,\\\\n2015. (DSMF \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][ 7).\\\\n\\\\nAfter thinking about the offer for several days, Plaintiff declined Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\noffer to reassign her to the Crown Road facility. (Moten Dep. at 96-97). Plaintiff told\\\\nMs. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal that she felt like she had been wrongfully terminated; that she did not want\\\\nto start back on a new 90-day probationary period; that if she lost her seniority, she\\\\nwould be at risk of being laid off due to lack of work and probably would be the first\\\\nto go. Under those circumstances, and without any guaranties that Plaintiff would not\\\\nbe laid off or exempted from the 90-day probationary period requirement, Plaintiff told\\\\nMs. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal that she could not accept the reassignment. (I_d at 97).\\\\n\\\\nOn or about April 8, 2014, Plaintiff filed a claim of discrimination with the USPS\\\\n\\\\nEqual Employment Opportunity (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEEO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d) office. (Doc. 38-1 at 12). Plaintiff claimed\\\\n\\\\n17A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 18 of 39\\\\n\\\\nthat she was disparately treated, harassed, subj ected to a hostile work environment, and\\\\ndiscriminated against 011 the basis of her race (black) and seX (female) when, on\\\\nFebruary 8, 2014, she was not issued a scan guard for scanning mail; she was falsely\\\\naccused of leaving an express mail package at the office; on unspecified dates in\\\\nFebruary, she worked ten hours of overtime, but was not paid for those hours; on\\\\nMarch 3, 2014, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Human Resources about harassment at the\\\\nWoodstock Post Office, and management reduced Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s work hours from six hours\\\\nto three hours a day; on March 22, 2014, management told Plaintiff that she was\\\\nterminated from the USPS; and Plaintiff never received anything from the USPS\\\\nregarding her termination. (I_d.).\\\\n\\\\nAn inquiry was conducted, and Postmaster Ledford and Bridget 0\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Neal provided\\\\nresponses to Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s claims. (Doc. 38-1 at 12). Sherry Garrett was interviewed by\\\\na union representative about the reasons for terminating Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s employment. (Doc.\\\\n40-2 at 5-12 [\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGarrett Interview\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]). After the inquiry was concluded, Plaintiff was\\\\ninformed that there was no resolution to Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s request for counseling, and she had\\\\nthe option to file a formal complaint, which apparently Plaintiff did. (Doc. 38-1 at 1,\\\\n8, 13). After Plaintiff filed her formal complaint, there was an investigation of her\\\\n\\\\nclaims. An investigative report was prepared, and a hearing was conducted on May 20,\\\\n\\\\n18A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 19 of 39\\\\n\\\\n2015 before an administrative judge. (Doc. 38-2). Portions of the investigative report\\\\n(\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cROI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d) and the transcript of the administrative hearing have been submitted as\\\\nattachments to Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 38). Plaintiff has\\\\nalso submitted several pages from the ROI in support of her claims. (Docs. 40-1\\\\nthrough 40-4).\\\\n\\\\nSometime between May 20, 2014 and September 28, 2015, Lana Layton, the\\\\nadministrative judge that conducted the administrative hearing in Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Equal\\\\nEmployment Opportunity case, issued a decision finding that Plaintiff had failed to\\\\nshow that she was the Victim of illegal discrimination. (Doc. 3 at 11). Plaintiff was\\\\nnotified of the agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s final decision of no-discrimination on or about October 1, 2015,\\\\nand Plaintiff was issued a notice of right to sue letter. (Li at 11-12).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s complaint in this case was docketed on January 5, 2016. (Doc. 3,\\\\nC0mp1.). After the extended discovery period closed, Defendant filed the instant\\\\nmotion for summary judgment. (Doc. 35). The motion has been fully briefed and is\\\\n\\\\nbefore the Court for consideration.\\\\n\\\\n19A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 20 of 39\\\\n\\\\nV. DISCUSSION\\\\nA. Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Claims\\\\n\\\\nIn her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she is asserting the following claims under\\\\nTitle VII: (1) discrimination based on sex; (2) discrimination based on race;\\\\n(3) harassment; (4) retaliation; and (5) wrongful termination. (Doc. 3, Comp1., at 7).\\\\nThe complaint, however, contains very few factual allegations in support of these\\\\nclaims.\\\\n\\\\nIn its motion for summary judgment, Defendant states that during Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ndeposition, Plaintiff clarified Which of her allegations constitute claims and Which are\\\\nbackgroundinformation. (Doc. 35-1 at 1-3). According to Defendant, Plaintifftestified\\\\nthat she is asserting two disparate treatment claims, one harassment claim, and two\\\\nretaliation claims. In Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s response brief, she has not challenged Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nas sertion or summary of her relevant deposition testimony, or notified the Court that she\\\\ndisagrees With Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s summary of her claims. Accordingly, the Court Will address\\\\neach of the claims asserted by Plaintiff in her complaint and in her deposition, as\\\\n\\\\naddressed by Defendant in its motion for summary judgment.\\\\n\\\\n20A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv-04515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 3 of 39\\\\n\\\\nRule 6(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\\\\n\\\\nWhen an act may or must be done Within a specified time, the\\\\ncourt may, for good cause, extend the time:\\\\n\\\\n(A) With or Without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a\\\\n\\\\nrequest is made, before the original time or its extension\\\\n\\\\nexpires; or\\\\n\\\\n(B) on motion made after the time has expired if the party\\\\n\\\\nfailed to act because of excusable neglect.\\\\nFed.

Disparate Treatment Claims\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff is as serting two claims of disparate treatment under Title VII. Disparate\\\\ntreatment claims, brought under Title VII, require proof of discriminatory intent.\\\\nVessels V. Atlanta Indep_. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 767-68 (11th Cir. 2005). Where, like\\\\nhere, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, there are several ways a plaintiff can\\\\n\\\\nshow discriminatory intent using indirect or circumstantial evidence. Hamilton V.\\\\n\\\\nSouthland Christian Sch. Inc., 680 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir. 2012). One way is\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nthrough the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Cog; V.

Sex and Race Discrimination with Regard to Express Mail\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff alleges in her complaint that she was treated differently than her white\\\\ncounterparts at the Woodstock Post Office. (Compl. at 7). Plaintiff testified that a\\\\nwhite, male coworker, Seth Talley, another PSE who worked at the Woodstock Post\\\\n\\\\nOffice, is her comparator for her disparate treatment claim based on seX and race.\\\\n\\\\n(Moten Dep. at 46-47, 69, 76-77, 85). Plaintiff testified that her supervisor, Ms. Garrett,\\\\n\\\\n23A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 24 of 39\\\\n\\\\ntreated Plaintiff differently than Seth Talley when Ms. Garrett accused Plaintiff of\\\\nfailing to dispatch express mail and gave that as one of the reasons Plaintiff was being\\\\nterminated. Plaintiff testified that it had to have been Talley, not she, who left the\\\\nexpress mail package around the date of Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s termination because she was not at\\\\nwork on the day she was accused of having left the package. (I_d. at 77-80).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of sex or race discrimination\\\\nbased on disparate treatment. Plaintiff has not provided or pointed to any evidence in\\\\nthe record showing that Talley ever failed to dispatch express mail, or that if he did fail\\\\nto dispatch express mail, that he was not reprimanded or held responsible for that\\\\nfailure. Ms. Garrett testified that she was the supervisor on duty at the times in\\\\nquestion, and she had personal knowledge that Plaintiff was assigned dispatch duty on\\\\nthose days. (Doc. 38-2 at 15-16). Ms. Garrett further testified that to her knowledge,\\\\nTalley never missed scans, never forgot to dispatch any express mail, and his overall\\\\nperformance was good. (Ld. at 18). Plaintiff has submitted no evidence that contradicts\\\\n0r controverts this testimony. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence\\\\nshowing that Mr. Talley was treated more favorably than she with regard to\\\\n\\\\nmishandling express mail.\\\\n\\\\n24A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 25 of 39\\\\n\\\\nEven if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s disparate treatment\\\\nclaim still fails because the USPS has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason\\\\nfor counseling Plaintiff about not properly dispatching express mail: i.e., Ms. Garrett\\\\nwas on duty with Plaintiff at the relevant times, and determined that Plaintiff was\\\\nresponsible for dispatch. The express mail did not go out, and Ms. Garrett concluded\\\\nthat Plaintiff was responsible. Plaintiff has failed to show that Ms. Garrett\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\nexplanation for confronting Plaintiff about the express mail was pretext for race or seX\\\\ndiscrimination. Plaintiff has also failed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence to\\\\ncreate a triable issue concerning the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s discriminatory intent.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, Plaintiff has failed to present any argument in opposition to summary\\\\njudgment on her express mail disparate treatment claim. In this district, failure to\\\\nrespond to arguments relating to a claim in the plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s initial response to the motion\\\\nconstitutes abandonment of the claim. & Wilkerson V. Grinnell Cogp., 270 F.3d 1314,\\\\n1322 (11th Cir. 2001) (deeming claim abandoned where argument was not presented\\\\n\\\\nin initial response to motion for summary judgment); see also White V. Ga.

Race Discrimination with Regard to Scan Guards\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff next contends that Ms. Garrett treated her differently than her White\\\\ncoworker, Denise Reinagel, When Ms. Garrett failed to provide Plaintiff With a scan\\\\nguard to help prevent scanning errors. (Moten Dep. at 70-73).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scan guard disparate treatment claim lacks a factual 0r evidentiary\\\\nbasis. Plaintiff testified that near the end of her employment at the Woodstock Post\\\\nOffice, Plaintiff learned that there was something called a scan guard that could be used\\\\nto help prevent scanning errors. (Ld. at 71). Plaintiff testified that at some unidentified\\\\ntime, Ms. Reinagel told Plaintiff that she had used a scan guard. (Ld. at 72). However,\\\\nPlaintiff also testified that Plaintiff never asked for a scan guard, and she never saw\\\\nMs. Reinagel use one, even though she and Ms. Reinagle worked on the same shift at\\\\nleast 90 percent of the time. (Li). Plaintiff further testified that she did not know Where\\\\nscan guards were stored, if scan guards were a piece of equipment that employees had\\\\n\\\\nto sign out, or that she had any knowledge about scan guards beyond her understanding\\\\n\\\\n26A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 27 of 39\\\\n\\\\nthat they were available or should have been available like any other equipment. (Ld.\\\\nat 72-73).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff has not satisfied the elements of a prima facie case of disparate treatment\\\\nwith regard to not being provided a scan guard. Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence\\\\ntending to show that Ms. Garrett or anyone else at the Woodstock Post Office ever\\\\nissued Ms. Reinagle (or any other employee) a scan guard. Ms. Garrett testified that in\\\\nten years, she has never issued a scan guard to any employee. (Doc. 38-2 at 16).\\\\nAccording to the USPS \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s EEO office, Postmaster Ledford also reported that none of the\\\\nWoodstock clerks used a scan guard to scan mail. (Doc. 38-1 at 18). Plaintiff herself\\\\ntestified that she never observed any employee at the Woodstock Post Office use a scan\\\\nguard, and she never asked anyone if she could have or use a scan guard. (Moten Dep.\\\\nat 71-72). Plaintiff argues that Postmaster Ledford testified that scan guards were\\\\nordered after Plaintiff was terminated, but this argument undermines rather than\\\\nsupports her contention that she was disparately treated. (Doc. 40 at 2; Doc. 40-2 at\\\\n16).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff has failed to show that Ms. Reinagle was treated more favorably than\\\\nshe. Plaintiff has also failed to show that not being issued a scan guard was pretextual\\\\n\\\\nfor race discrimination.\\\\n\\\\n27A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 28 of 39\\\\n\\\\nFor the reasons stated, I recommend that summary judgment be granted on\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s disparate treatment claims.\\\\n\\\\nC. Harassment Claim\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff next alleges that Loretta Gomez harassed her, that Plaintiff complained\\\\nabout the alleged harassment to Human Resources, but the USPS failed to address her\\\\ncomplaints and failed to follow its anti-harassment procedure. (Doc. 40 at 1; Moten\\\\nDep. at 74, 82-83).\\\\n\\\\nThe employee has the burden of proving a hostile work environment claim based\\\\non harassment. & Edwards V. Wallace Cmty. C011., 49 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.\\\\n1995). In order to set forth a prima facie case, a plaintiff must demonstrate the\\\\nfollowing essential elements: (1) that she belongs to a protected group; (2) that she has\\\\nbeen subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment was based on a\\\\nprotected characteristic; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to\\\\nalter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive\\\\n\\\\nworking environment; and (5) that there is a basis for holding the employer liable for\\\\n\\\\nthe harassment. \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82 Furcron V.

App\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99X 100, 101 (11th Cir. 2005). The \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csevere and pervasive\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d element contains both\\\\nan objective and a subjective component.

(Moten Dep. at 74, 82, 91; Doc. 38-1 at\\\\n23). Plaintiff alleged in her email that Loretta Gomez was harassing Plaintiff by making\\\\nit impossible for her to complete her dispatch because, instead of letting Plaintiff load\\\\nthe truck near the end of her workday, Gomez was making Plaintiff re-do a scan that she\\\\nhad performed earlier in the day, even though other employees were available to do the\\\\nscan. (Doc. 38-1 at 23). Plaintiff confirmed in her deposition that she was not alleging\\\\nthat Gomez\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s harassment was due to race, seX, or any other protected status covered by\\\\nTitle VII. (Moten Dep. at 91-92). Rather, Plaintiff testified that the alleged harassment\\\\nconsisted of Ms. Gomez yelling and screaming at her about doing different work details.\\\\n(Ld. at 83, 109). Plaintiff further contends that her termination was based, at least in\\\\npart, on a report from Ms. Gomez that she was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cunhappy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d with Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s job\\\\nperformance. (Ld. at 83, 109; Doc. 40 at 2; Doc. 40-2 at 3).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s harassment claim fails for several reasons. First, Plaintiff has not\\\\n\\\\nargued or established that requiring her to re-do a scan or scans constitutes an adverse\\\\n\\\\n3OA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv-04515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 4 of 39\\\\n\\\\nII.

(Li. at 79).\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff has not pointed to any evidence in the record suggesting that she\\\\nparticipated in any formal investigation or proceeding before she was terminated on\\\\nMarch 22, 2014.

White, 2006 WL 2443848, at *25.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nFor an employee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s opposition activity to be protected under the anti-retaliation\\\\nprovision of Title VII, the employee must be opposing conduct that is made an\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cunlawful employment practice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d by Title VII. I_d. Title VII defines an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cunlawful\\\\nemployment practice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as, inter alia, discrimination against an employee \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith respect\\\\nto his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\\\\nindividual\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s race, color, religion, seX, or national origin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d 42 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 2000e-2(a).\\\\nIn other words, it is not enough for a plaintiff to show that she opposed garden-variety\\\\nunfairness or harsh treatment in the workplace; she is only protected from retaliation if\\\\n\\\\nthe practice she opposed or complained about is specifically prohibited by Title VII.\\\\n\\\\n35A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 36 of 39\\\\n\\\\nWhite, 2006 WL 2443848, at *26.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nWith regard to Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s reduction-in-hours claim, Plaintiff testified that she felt\\\\nlike she was treated differently than her comparator, Seth Talley. (Moten Dep. at 80-82,\\\\n85-86). The record shows that for several weeks before Plaintiff sent her March 3, 2014\\\\nemail, Plaintiff was complaining that her hours were too long. On or about March 10,\\\\n2014, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s hours were reduced. Plaintiff then became concerned that the\\\\nreduction in her work hours was too drastic and she was not being given the same time\\\\nto complete her dispatch as her white male counterpart, Seth Talley. (Moten Dep. at 80,\\\\n85; Doc. 38-1 at 8). Plaintiff claims that her hours were reduced in retaliation for\\\\nvoicing her concerns about her work situation.\\\\n\\\\nDefendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s uncontroverted evidence shows that between March 10, 2014 and\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s termination on the 22nd, Plaintiff worked twelve days, while PSE Talley\\\\nworked nine days. (DSMF HI 19). Plaintiff worked 92.19 hours during this period, and\\\\n\\\\nPSE Talley worked 68.22 hours. (Id.; Doc. 38-1 at 29-34, 35-38). During the days both\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff and Talley worked the same day, Plaintiff worked 71.74 hours, while Talley\\\\n\\\\nworked 68.22. (DSMF HI 20). In her response brief, Plaintiff concedes that the record\\\\nshows she worked more hours than Talley did. (Doc. 40 at 2).\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to her termination, it is undisputed that Plaintiff suffered an adverse\\\\n\\\\n36A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 37 of 39\\\\n\\\\nemployment action when she was terminated on March 22, 2014. However, Plaintiff\\\\nhas failed to show that she opposed conduct that is specifically prohibited by Title VII.\\\\nPlaintiff admitted in her deposition that her March 3rd email to Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal did not\\\\nconstitute an internal complaint of race- or gender-based discrimination under Title VII.\\\\n(Moten Dep. at 91-92). It is undisputed that the email sent by Plaintiff to Ms. O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Neal\\\\ndid not reference Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s race, gender, or other protected classification. Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nemail raised concerns regarding the lack of a time card, schedule changes, long hours,\\\\nand treatment by Loretta Gomez, but did not allege that these issues were due to any\\\\ntype of discrimination or discriminatory conduct prohibited by Title VII. Plaintiff has\\\\nfailed to show that she engaged in any protected activity prior to the reduction in her\\\\nhours and her separation from the Woodstock Post Office.\\\\n\\\\nIn sum, Plaintiff has failed to establish that her work hours were reduced more\\\\nthan Talley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s, or that Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s hours were reduced for retaliatory purposes. Plaintiff\\\\nhas also failed to show that she engaged in any protected activity, much less a causal\\\\nconnection between such activity and her discharge. For the reasons stated,\\\\nI recommend that Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s retaliation\\\\n\\\\nclaims be granted.\\\\n\\\\n37A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 38 of 39\\\\n\\\\nE. Other Contentions\\\\n\\\\nFinally, Plaintiff does not allege in her Complaint but argues in her response brief\\\\nthat she was wrongfully terminated because she was not a probationary employee at the\\\\ntime of her discharge. (Doc. 40 at 2). Plaintiff, however, has failed to point to or\\\\nprovide any probative evidence that would support such a claim. The only evidence\\\\nshe has submitted to support her assertion is an unsigned, unauthenticated, undated\\\\nstatement of union contentions in an earlier proceeding asserting that Plaintiff was not\\\\na probationary employee and her termination violated certain contractual obligations\\\\nbetween the union and the USPS. (Doc. 40-4 at 1-3). The statement does not mention\\\\nTitle VII or assert that Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s termination was in any way discriminatory or\\\\nretaliatory on the basis of race, seX, or any other protected characteristic.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to being unauthenticated, inadmissible hearsay, this evidence is not\\\\nprobative of whether Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s reasons for terminating Plaintiff were a cloak for race\\\\nor seX discrimination. Plaintiff has made no attempt to link her contention that she was\\\\nnot a probationary employee to her Title VII claims. Nor has Plaintiff provided\\\\nsufficient probative evidence showing that Ms. Garrett\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s reasons for terminating\\\\nPlaintiff were implausible or not worthy of belief. Plaintiff has also failed to show how\\\\n\\\\nthe record evidence creates a genuine is sue of material fact as to intent or pretext, based\\\\n\\\\n38Case 1:15-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 39 of 39\\\\n\\\\non the nature of the reasons offered in combination With other circumstantial evidence.\\\\nReeves V.

Plaintiff Gibson likewise did not include her\\\\nclaims against Gentiva in her schedule of assets and never amended her schedules to\\\\ninclude these claims. On December 29, 2010, the bankruptcy court discharged\\\\nPlaintiff Gibson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s debts under Chapter 7. On September 6, 201 1, after she opted into\\\\nthe Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eisch class action, Plaintiff Gibson \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led a second bankruptcy petition \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this\\\\ntime for reorganization under Chapter 11. She \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led her schedules on September 30,\\\\n2011, and, again, she did not include her claims against Gentiva or amend her\\\\nschedules to do so. On October 19, 2011, Plaintiff Gibson re-\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led her schedules in\\\\nher bankruptcy, but did not include her claims against Gentiva. The bankruptcy court\\\\nultimately dismissed Plaintiff Gibson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy case on December 10,\\\\n2012, and closed the case on December 26, 2012. Plaintiff Gibson never amended her\\\\npleadings to identify her claims against Gentiva. On May 5, 2015, Plaintiff Gibson\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led her pending suit against Gentiva.\\\\n\\\\nDiscussion\\\\nAs noted above, Defendant asserts that it is entitled to judgment With respect\\\\nto Plaintiffs Harris\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and Gibson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s suits because Plaintiffs do not have standing to\\\\n\\\\npursue their claims because those claims became the property of the bankruptcy estate,A0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8l82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 846 Filed 09/08/16 Page 4 of 7\\\\n\\\\nLC.

This\\\\nCourt, however, concludes that Defendant is incorrect.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Order of March 23, 2016, [Doc. 804 in Case No. 1:15-CV-55555], this\\\\nCourt held that the two-year statute of limitations applies to the Fair Labor Standards\\\\nAct suits pending in this Court against Defendant. Accordingly, Plaintiff Harris\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nclaims to overtime pay are limited to those workweeks beginning on April 23, 2013,\\\\nand Plaintiff Gibson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s claims begin on May 5, 2013. There is no indication that these\\\\nPlaintiffs intend to argue that they are entitled to any type of equitable tolling based\\\\non what happened in Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eisch and Biiley, and, if they did, Defendant would\\\\ncertainly argue strenuously (and rightfully) that these are entirely new cases and there\\\\n\\\\nis no basis to conclude that Plaintiffs are entitled to tolling because of the earlier failed\\\\n\\\\ncases. This Court thus concludes that it would likewise be improper to look back atA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 846 Filed 09/08/16 Page 5 of 7\\\\n\\\\nwhat happened in those earlier cases to determine what Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 duties and rights\\\\nwere with respect to their claims as they relate to their bankruptcy actions.\\\\nAccordingly, this Court will ignore Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eisch and Ba_iley in analyzing the parties\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\narguments.\\\\n\\\\nTurning \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81rst to the question of Plaintiff Harris\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 claims, she \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led her suit well\\\\nafter she \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and the fact that her bankruptcy case\\\\nlingered beyond the date that she \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led her suit here is of no consequence because, as\\\\na general matter, Chapter 7 debtors retain possession of property \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 including legal\\\\n\\\\nclaims \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94-- acquired after they \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81le their bankruptcy petition.

In that same\\\\norder, J udge J ones struck the testimony of the plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 expert. In another order, i_Q1_.\\\\ndoc. 785, Judge J ones concluded that the accurate measure of the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 damages\\\\n\\\\nwould be half\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94time pay for the hours that the plaintiffs worked in excess of forty in\\\\n\\\\n1 For a complete discussion of the PPV Plan, gee Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eisch V.

Defendant has \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81led a motion in the cases pending before the\\\\nundersigned seeking an order adopting these rulings by J udge J ones. [Doc. 623].\\\\n\\\\nAt the outset, this Court disagrees with Defendant that the law of the case\\\\ndoctrine applies to Judge Jones\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rulings. Under that doctrine, a ruling made in a\\\\ncertain case remains binding on the parties in that case. Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eish orders made after\\\\ndeserti\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81cation of the class in that case are not binding on these cases. However, this\\\\nCourt agrees with Plaintiffs that it can construe Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion as one seeking\\\\nsummary judgment on the issues raised, and for obvious reasons of j udicial ef\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ciency,\\\\nthis Court Will do just that. In such event, Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate the same\\\\narguments that were raised by the plaintiffs in Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eisch in response to Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\nsummary judgment motions. [Doc. 640 at 4].\\\\n\\\\nThis Court has carefully reviewed Judge J ones\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 extensive \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ndings of fact and\\\\nthe conclusions based upon those \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81ndings in the two orders from Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eisch\\\\nmentioned above. With one exception discussed below, this Court agrees fully with\\\\nJ udge J ones and adopts those conclusions into this case. Accordingly, this Court now\\\\nconcludes that (1) Defendant did not act willfully in Violating the FLSA by\\\\nimplementing the PPV Plan, and the FLSA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two-year statute of limitations applies\\\\nto Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 claims against Defendant, (2) Defendant acted in good faith in adopting\\\\n\\\\nthe PPV Plan so that Plaintiffs are not entitled to recover liquidated damages under theA0 72A\\\\n(Rev.8/82)\\\\n\\\\nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 804 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 3\\\\n\\\\nAct, and (3) the accurate measure of the Plaintiffs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 damages in these cases is half\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94time\\\\npay for the hours that the plaintiffs worked in excess of forty in any one week.\\\\n\\\\nThis Court will not, however, adopt Judge J ones\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 stance as it relates to experts\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 at least not yet. In the order of November 24, 2016, this Court expressed its\\\\nskepticism that expert testimony is required to resolve the issues in this case. That\\\\nskepticism still holds, but as there does not seem to be any expert testimony to strike\\\\nat this time, this Court will limit its holding by requiring only that the parties obtain\\\\nleave of this Court before beginning discovery related to expert witnesses.\\\\n\\\\nFor the reasons stated, Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s motion, [Doc. 623], is GRANTED, and this\\\\n\\\\nCourt adopts Judge J ones\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 orders from the Rind\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82eish case as discussed.\\\\n\\\\nIT IS SO ORDERED, this Z7/day of March, 2016.\\\\n\\\\nWILLIS B.

Thus, the term\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdiscretion and independent judgment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d does not require that the\\\\ndecisions made by an employee have a \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81nality that goes With\\\\nunlimited authority and a complete absence of review.

More importantly, the evidence cited by\\\\nBynum does not contradict the evidence presented by Defendant detailing the more\\\\ncomplete picture of her job description.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, Bynum cites an excerpt from the deposition of her fellow\\\\n\\\\ninvestigator, Michelle Magwood, in Which Magwood testi\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81es that her\\\\n\\\\n17Case 1:16-cv-00001-MHC Document 44 Filed 07/10/17 Page 18 of 23\\\\n\\\\ninvestigatory duties as an investigator was limited to interviewing witnesses,\\\\nsurveillance, and writing reports. Magwood Dep. at 119. However, this\\\\ntestimony, in which another investigator chose summarily to characterize her\\\\nparticular job duties in a concise manner, does not constitute evidence that a CCSD\\\\nPD investigator\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job duties did not include the full gamut of responsibilities\\\\ndelineated in the written job description, which Bynum con\\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x81rmed were accurate\\\\nduring her deposition.

R. CiV. P. 56(0). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of\\\\ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes\\\\nv. S. H. Kress & C0., 398 U.S. 144, 175 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724\\\\nF.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court\\\\nthat there is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9can absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Celotex\\\\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). In making its determination, the court\\\\nmust View the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the\\\\nnonmoving party.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving\\\\nparty must come forward With specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a\\\\ngenuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S.\\\\n574, 587 (1986). The nonmoving party is required \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto go beyond the pleadings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and\\\\nto present competent evidence designating \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cspecific facts showing that there is a\\\\n\\\\ngenuine issue for trial.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[t]he mere existence of\\\\n\\\\n13Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 14 of 35\\\\n\\\\na scintilla of evidence\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d supporting the nonmoving party\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s case is insufficient to defeat\\\\na motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252\\\\n(1986).\\\\n\\\\nWhen considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make\\\\ndecisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249;\\\\nRyder Int\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99l Corp. v. F irstAmerican Nat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991).\\\\nRather, the court only determines Whether there are genuine issues of material fact to\\\\nbe tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those\\\\nthat are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or\\\\naffect the outcome of a suit Will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\\\\nId.\\\\n\\\\nIf a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness\\\\nof the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by\\\\nevidence, or if it is created by evidence that is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmerely colorable\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d or is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnot\\\\nsignificantly probative.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif the evidence is such that\\\\na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id. at 242.\\\\nMoreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record.\\\\nMatsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmust do more than simply show\\\\n\\\\nthat there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id. at 586. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere the\\\\n\\\\n14Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 15 of 35\\\\n\\\\nrecord taken as a Whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-\\\\nmoving party, there is no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98genuine issue for trial.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Id. at 587 (quoting F irst Nat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99l\\\\nBank ofArizona v. Cities Service C0., 391 U.S. 253, 289 (1968)). Thus, the standard\\\\nfor summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhether the evidence\\\\npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or Whether it is so\\\\none-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of 1aw.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9dAnders0n, 477 U.S. at 259.\\\\n\\\\nB. Plaintijf\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Title VII Race Discrimination Claim\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s only remaining claim is for race discrimination under Title VII of the\\\\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Which provides that it is unlawful for an employer \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto\\\\ndiscriminate against any individual With respect to his compensation, terms,\\\\nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s race, color,\\\\nreligion, seX, or national origin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d 42 U.S.C. \\\\xc2\\\\xa7 2000e-2(a)(1).

Because direct\\\\n\\\\nevidence of discrimination is seldom available, a plaintiff must typically rely on\\\\n\\\\n16Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 17 of 35\\\\n\\\\ncircumstantial evidence to prove discriminatory intent, using the framework\\\\n\\\\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Under this framework, a plaintiff is first required\\\\nto create an inference of discriminatory intent, and thus carries the initial burden of\\\\nestablishing a prima facie case of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at\\\\n802; see also Jones v. Bessemer Carraway Medical Ctr., 137 F.3d 1306, 1310, reh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99g\\\\ndenied and opinion superseded in part, 151 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 1998); Combs, 106\\\\nF.3d at 1527.\\\\n\\\\nDemonstrating a prima facie case is not onerous; it requires only that the\\\\nplaintiff establish facts adequate to permit an inference of discrimination. Jones, 137\\\\nF.3d at 1310-1311;H0lifield, 115 F.3d at 1562; see Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54. Once\\\\nthe plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant must \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9carticulate some\\\\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for the adverse employment action. M cDonnell\\\\nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Jones, 137 F.3d at 1310. This burden is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cexceedingly light\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nin comparison to the burden required if the plaintiff has presented direct evidence of\\\\n\\\\ndiscrimination. Smith v. Homer, 839 F.2d 1530, 1537 (11th Cir. 1988). If the\\\\n\\\\ndefendant is able to carry this burden and explain its rationale, the plaintiff, in order\\\\n\\\\n17Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 18 of 35\\\\n\\\\nto prevail, must then show that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for\\\\ndiscrimination. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9454; Perryman v. Johnson Prods. C0.,\\\\n698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983).\\\\n\\\\nA plaintiff is entitled to survive a defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motion for summary judgment\\\\nif there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of\\\\nmaterial fact regarding the truth of the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s proffered reasons for its actions.\\\\nCombs, 106 F.3d at 1529. A primafacie case along With sufficient evidence to reject\\\\nthe employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s explanation is all that is needed to permit a finding of intentional\\\\ndiscrimination. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod, Inc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000); see\\\\nalso St. Mary\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Honor Ctr. v.

Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate\\\\nthe evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of\\\\ndiscrimination.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d United States Postal Serv. Bd. ofGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711,\\\\n715 (1983); see also Grigsby v. Reynolds Metals C0., 821 F.2d 590, 594 (11th Cir.\\\\n1987). The Eleventh Circuit has held that this framework of shifting burdens of proof\\\\nis a valuable tool for analyzing evidence in cases involving alleged disparate\\\\n\\\\ntreatment, but the framework is only a tool. Nix v. WLC Y Radio/Rahall Comm, 738\\\\n\\\\n18Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 19 of 35\\\\n\\\\nF.2d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir. 1984). The \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cultimate question\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is not Whether a plaintiff\\\\nhas established a prima facie case or demonstrated pretext, but \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhether the defendant\\\\nintentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id., 738 F.2d at 1184 (quoting\\\\nAikens, 460 U.S. at 713- 14); see also Jones, 137 F.3d at 1313. The plaintiff retains the\\\\nultimate burden of proving that the defendant is guilty of intentional discrimination.\\\\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 253.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant discriminated\\\\nagainst him on the basis of his race (African-American) in Violation of Title VII.\\\\nSpecifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s decision to terminate Plaintiff was\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cintentional and based solely on Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s desire to minimize the amount of\\\\nAfrican Americans Who were employed at Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s South Georgia plant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Am.\\\\nCompl. [12] at HI 27. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s purported reason\\\\nfor his termination is merely pretextual. Am. Compl. at HI 28. Plaintiff does not\\\\ncontend that he has produced any direct evidence of any discriminatory intent, and the\\\\nundersigned finds that he has not done so. Thus, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s claim of race\\\\ndiscrimination rests purely on circumstantial evidence and must be analyzed under the\\\\n\\\\nMcDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework.\\\\n\\\\n19Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 20 of 35\\\\n\\\\n1. Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Prima Facie Case\\\\n\\\\nUnder the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework, a plaintiff can generally\\\\nestablish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under Title VII by showing\\\\nthat: 1) he is a member of a protected class;6 2) he was subjected to an adverse\\\\nemployment action by his employer; 3) he was qualified to do the job in question; and\\\\n4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his protected\\\\nclassification (i.e., those of a different seX, race, or religion) more favorably than it\\\\ntreated him. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 US. at 802; see also Wright v. Southland\\\\nCorp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir. 1999); Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562\\\\n(11th Cir. 1997). The Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff is a member of a\\\\nprotected class and he was qualified to do the job in question. Defendant contends,\\\\nhowever, that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of race discrimination\\\\nbecause he has failed to present evidence showing that Stratas treated anyone outside\\\\n\\\\nhis protected class more favorably than it treated him. The Court agrees.\\\\n\\\\n6 Although courts continue to include the requirement that a plaintiff establish\\\\nas part of a prima facie case that he or she is a member of a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cprotected class,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it is\\\\nclear that individuals of any seX, race, or religion may pursue claims of employment\\\\ndiscrimination under Title VII. See Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1290\\\\nn.3 (11th Cir. 1999) (Citing McDonald v. Santa F e Trail Transp. C0., 427 US. 273,\\\\n278-80 (1976)). Thus, the key element of the prima facie case is establishing that\\\\npersons outside of the plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s protected classification (i.e., those of a different seX,\\\\nrace, or religion) were treated more favorably by the employer. See Wright, 187 F.3d\\\\n\\\\nat 1290 n.3.\\\\n20Case 1:16-cv-00081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 3 of 35\\\\n\\\\nCourt deems those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1B.

In fact, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only mention of a comparator is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chis former supervisor, who,\\\\ncoincidentally, was also African-American and was also terminated.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Pl.

It is Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s burden, however, to prove his claims,\\\\nand specifically to demonstrate there is evidence of material fact to establish a prima\\\\nfacie case of discrimination. Notably, Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence that any\\\\nCaucasian employees, or, indeed, any other employees at all other than Breeden,\\\\nviolated the Employee Purchase Program.\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff makes other conclusory allegations, claiming that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[t]he disparity\\\\nbetween the treatment of white employees and the African-American employees who\\\\nwere terminated is clear\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[t]here is no question that the actions of the recently-\\\\nhired Caucasian plant manager treated any non-African-American in a similar\\\\nfashion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id. In addition, Plaintiff argues that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9call the evidence before this Court\\\\nindicates that Defendant restructured its management and proceed to systematically\\\\neliminate long-term African-American employees at an astonishing rate.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Id. But\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s general allegations cite to no record evidence and are wholly unsupported\\\\nby the facts outlined above.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, to the extent that Plaintiff relies on the allegation that there were\\\\nwhite employees selling oil to Plaintiff, and that these white employees were not\\\\nterminated, Plaintiff neither cites to record evidence to support this contention nor\\\\n\\\\naddresses the proper question\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 whether there were white employees who were\\\\n\\\\n23Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 24 of 35\\\\n\\\\nengaged in storing oil on Stratas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s premises who were not terminated. In addition,\\\\neven if Plaintiff were addressing the proper issue, there is nothing to indicate from\\\\nwhom Plaintiff purchased oil in excess of the four jugs he was allowed to purchase\\\\nfrom Stratas per pay period. Without any citations to evidence to support these\\\\nallegations, it is simply impossible for the Court to determine whether the Plaintiff has\\\\npresented sufficient evidence to establish that there were other employees who were\\\\nsimilarly situated to the Plaintiff in all relevant respects and committed similar\\\\ninfractions, but were treated differently. For these reasons, the Court finds that\\\\nPlaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence that Defendant treated a similarly\\\\nsituated Caucasian employee more favorably than it treated Plaintiff.\\\\n\\\\nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient\\\\nevidence to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination under Title VII and\\\\nDefendant is entitled to summary judgment. Even assuming that he had done so,\\\\nhowever, the Court finds that Defendant has presented a legitimate reason for the\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s termination, and Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of\\\\npretext.\\\\n\\\\n2. Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Legitimate Reason\\\\nThe Court finds that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it had a\\\\n\\\\nlegitimate reason for the Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s termination that was not based on his race. The\\\\n\\\\n24Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 25 of 35\\\\n\\\\ndetails surrounding the Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s termination are set forth in detail above. In sum,\\\\nDefendant contends that it terminated Plaintiff because he was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cstaging\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the oil he\\\\npurchased outside the Shipping Department, in Violation of the express instruction set\\\\nforth on the Order Form for purchases under the Employee Purchase Program. Def.\\\\nSMF \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][ 18-19. Because Defendant required employees to remove oil right away after\\\\npurchasing it through the Employee Purchase Program in order to keep track of its\\\\ninventory, and Plaintiff repeatedly violated the instruction, Defendant terminated\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s employment.\\\\n\\\\nIt is undisputed that since November 21, 2011, the Valdosta Plant had an\\\\nEmployee Purchase Program in place under Which employees could purchase oil from\\\\nStratas for their personal use. Def. SMF at HI 14. Through the Employee Purchase\\\\nProgram, oil was made available to employees of Stratas at a lower price than that\\\\nWhich Stratas charged its customers. Def. SMF at HI 15. Thus, there was a limit on the\\\\namount of oil employees could purchase\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a maximum of two jugs of each of two\\\\nkinds of oil, i.e., four jugs of oil per pay period. Def. SMF at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][ 16-17. As part of the\\\\nEmployee Purchase Program, employees had to fill out an Order Form and pick up\\\\ntheir orders from the Shipping Department at specified times. Def. SMF at HI 18. When\\\\nan employee picks up his order, he is supposed to promptly take it to his vehicle and\\\\n\\\\nemployees are not allowed to store their oil sales outside of the shipping office or in\\\\n\\\\n25Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 26 of 35\\\\n\\\\nthe warehouse according to the terms of the Order Form. Def. SMF at HI 19. This\\\\nrequirement is in place to ensure that Stratas can properly account for and track all\\\\njugs of oil leaving the warehouse. Def. SMF at HI 20.\\\\n\\\\nIt is also undisputed that Plaintiff regularly purchased his full allotment of oil\\\\nunder the Employee Purchase Program and regularly purchased additional jugs of oil\\\\nfrom other employees Who purchased their full allotments. Def. SMF at HI 21. Though\\\\nPlaintiff was allowed to park inside, it was still sometimes difficult for him to load the\\\\npurchased oil into his vehicle right away. Def. SMF at M 23-24. Thus, Plaintiff claims\\\\nthat his direct supervisor, Breeden, told him that he could stage his oil by the Shipping\\\\nDepartment. Def. SMF at HI 24.\\\\n\\\\nOn May 22, 2014, Simmons, the Plant Manager at the time, received a report\\\\nfrom a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9creliable Witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d that he or she had observed Plaintiff stealing jugs of oil from\\\\nStratas. Def. SMF at HI 25. Specifically, the Witness saw Plaintiff taking jugs of oil out\\\\nan open fire door and toward Breeden\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s car. Def. SMF at HI 26. Before speaking With\\\\nPlaintiff, Simmons independently verified that there had been no employee purchases\\\\nof oil on the date of the alleged theft, so there should not have been any cases of oil\\\\nleaving the facility aside from \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnormal orders.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Def. SMF at HI 27. When Simmons\\\\n\\\\nconfronted Plaintiff about the alleged theft, Plaintiff denied removing any oil from the\\\\n\\\\nPlant on that day. Def. SMF at HI 28.\\\\n\\\\n26Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 27 of 35\\\\n\\\\nIn July 2015, Metzler, who had by this time replaced Simmons as Plant\\\\nManager, learned of another potential theft and suspicious behavior from Plaintiff and\\\\nBreeden. Def. SMF at HI 29. Metzler, after he began to investigate, learned that\\\\nBreeden had called one or two people who he believed might have reported him to\\\\nmanagement for the alleged theft of oil. Def. SMF at HI 30. Metzler contacted\\\\nCorporate Security to investigate the situation further, and on August 5, 2015, two\\\\ninvestigators met Breeden and Plaintiff at the Valdosta Plant. Def. SMF at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][ 30-31.\\\\nPlaintiff and Breeden were questioned separately, and Plaintiff denied that he was\\\\naware of any theft but admitted that he had been purchasing additional oil beyond his\\\\nallotment from his fellow employees. Def. SMF at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98][ 31-32. Plaintiff also told the\\\\ninvestigators that he had been storing oil on the premises of the Valdosta Plant, rather\\\\nthan removing the oil right away. Def. SMF at HI 32. Thereafter, Plaintiff was\\\\nsuspended then terminated because he had violated the Employee Purchase Program\\\\nby storing the oil he purchased on Stratas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s premises instead of removing it\\\\nimmediately. Def. SMF at HI 33.\\\\n\\\\nIn sum, the Court finds that the Defendant has met the burden of presenting\\\\nsufficient evidence that it had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s employment. Thus, in order for Plaintiff to defeat the Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s Motion\\\\n\\\\nfor Summary J udgment, he must cite to competent evidence in the record that would\\\\n\\\\n27Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 28 of 35\\\\n\\\\nbe sufficient to establish that Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s proffered reason is a pretext for\\\\ndiscrimination.\\\\n3. Pretext\\\\n\\\\nA plaintiff may carry the burden of showing that the employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s proffered\\\\nreasons are pretextual by showing that they have no basis in fact, that they were not\\\\nthe true factors motivating the decision, or that the stated reasons were insufficient to\\\\nmotivate the decision. A plaintiff can either directly persuade the court that a\\\\ndiscriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or show indirectly that the\\\\nemployer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ultimate justification is not believable.

In other words, the plaintiff has the opportunity to come\\\\nforward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the\\\\nprima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the\\\\nreasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment\\\\ndecision.

Br.\\\\nat 7. Citing Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011),\\\\nPlaintiff attempts to use the case to skirt over the fact that he cannot show that a\\\\n\\\\nsimilarly situated individual outside the protected class was treated more favorably\\\\n\\\\n29Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 30 of 35\\\\n\\\\nthan he was and declares that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is clear that a genuine issue of material fact exists.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nP1. Br. at 7.\\\\n\\\\nIn Smith, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the plaintiff did not need to rely\\\\non the McDonnell Douglas presumption because \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe record contained sufficient\\\\nevidence to allow a jury to infer that [Defendant] Lockheed fired [Plaintiff] Mitten\\\\nbecause he is white.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Smith, 644 F.3d at 1328. Although the plaintiff had failed to\\\\nshow that he was disciplined less favorably under a zero tolerance policy than a\\\\nsimilarly situated black employee, the plaintiff had shown that there were\\\\npreferentially treated black employees in non-supervisory positions. Id. at 1326. In\\\\naddition, Plaintiff had set forth evidence that yielded the inference of race\\\\ndiscrimination, including that Lockheed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chad a substantial incentive to discipline\\\\nwhite employees more harshly than black employees\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d because it had received bad\\\\npublicity and that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLockheed consciously injected race considerations into its\\\\ndiscipline decision making without an adequate explanation for doing so\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d when it\\\\nused a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmatrix\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d that included race in making disciplinary decisions. Id. at 1341. Thus,\\\\neven though the plaintiff could not meet the fourth prong 0f the McDonnell Douglas\\\\nframework, the Eleventh Circuit found that there was sufficient circumstantial\\\\nevidence in the record to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\n\\\\ntermination was because of his race. That is, though deeming a person similarly\\\\n\\\\n30Case 1:16-cv-00081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 4 of 35\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s objections to Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Statement of Material Facts are almost\\\\nexclusively premised on Local Rule 56.1B(1)(a), that is, that the citation to the record\\\\nDefendant puts forth does not support Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s factual allegation. However,\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s objections concerning Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s citations to the record are overruled.\\\\nDefendant attached three exhibits to its Motion for Summary J udgment, and though\\\\nits references to the page numbers Within the exhibits cite to the original page numbers\\\\nof Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s deposition and the other documents, rather than to the page number\\\\nentered in the Court\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s filing system, Defendant properly cites support for its factual\\\\nallegations.2\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff also substantively disputes some of Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s proffered facts, but\\\\nthe maj ority of these disputes are over minor and immaterial is sues.3 Accordingly, the\\\\nCourt Will not rule on each and every objection or dispute presented by the parties,\\\\nand Will discuss those objections and disputes in the analysis section only When\\\\nnecessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact. Finally, the\\\\nCourt notes that Plaintiff misnumbers his obj ections as to Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Statement of\\\\nMaterial Facts beginning at Paragraphs 21 and 22. Thus, Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s responses to\\\\n\\\\nDefendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Statement of Material Facts diverge at Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Paragraph 22 (which\\\\n\\\\n2In referencing Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s deposition, Which is Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s Exhibit A, the Court\\\\nadopts Defendant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s method of citation.\\\\n\\\\n3Moreover, few of Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s responses actually cite to any record evidence.\\\\n\\\\n4Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 31 of 35\\\\n\\\\nsituated may require that the person occupy the same position as the plaintiff, that is\\\\nnot the exclusive means by Which to document evidence of racial discrimination.\\\\n\\\\nThus, While it is true that the McDonnell Douglas framework is not meant to\\\\nbe applied rigidly, and a plaintiff may raise a reasonable inference of an employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ndiscriminatory intent through various forms of circumstantial evidence, see Smith, 644\\\\nF.3d at 1328, there must be evidence from Which a factfinder could infer intentional\\\\ndiscrimination by the decisionmaker. Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s allegation, however, is nothing more\\\\nthan a conclusory statement that is unsupported by any evidence in the record and his\\\\nreliance on Smith is unfounded.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, Plaintiff suggests that because Defendant does not contest that\\\\nPlaintiff is a member of a protected class, was terminated, and had the ability to do the\\\\njob, there is automatically a genuine is sue of material fact such that summary\\\\njudgment is unwarranted. See id. (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat Defendant concedes the fact that three out of\\\\nfour tests have been decided in Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s favor makes it clear that summary judgment\\\\nis wholly inappropriate in this matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d). This is an incorrect interpretation of the\\\\nshowing required by a plaintiff to put forth a primafacie case of race discrimination,\\\\nand a Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s burden to show pretext is a heavier one than to set forth a primafacie\\\\ncase. Reliance on Smith for purposes of this argument is, as explained above,\\\\n\\\\ninapposite.\\\\n\\\\n31Case 1:16-cv\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 32 of 35\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff has provided no evidence to support his allegations. Indeed, even\\\\nPlaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s testimony does not indicate that Metzler was motivated in any way by race.\\\\nPlaintiff testified that Metzler refused to speak to all people who worked on the \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82oor\\\\nof the Plant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 whether African-American or Caucasian. He also testified that the people\\\\nwho worked upstairs, in offices near Metzler and away from the Plant \\\\xef\\\\xac\\\\x82oor, were both\\\\nCaucasian and African-American. Plaintiff testified that one Caucasian employee,\\\\nwho was a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cleadman,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d like Plaintiff, also had a desk upstairs. Def. EX. A at 211-14.\\\\nHowever, there is no evidence that the Caucasian employee engaged in similar\\\\nconduct to Plaintiff, i.e., staged oil on Stratas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s premises, or that his duties were\\\\nsimilar to Plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s because he was not a part of the Packaging Department. This\\\\nalone, then, is not evidence of any kind of pervasive atmosphere of race\\\\ndiscrimination. Though Plaintiff believes that Metzler was motivated by race, he has\\\\nproffered no evidence that supports these allegations at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line is that Plaintiff has provided no record support for his beliefs,\\\\nand the Court cannot sit in judgment of an employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s decision, absent evidence that\\\\na discriminatory motive was the underlying basis. As the Eleventh Circuit has\\\\nexplained:\\\\n\\\\nTitle VII does not take away an employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s right to interpret its rules as\\\\n\\\\nit chooses, and to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules.\\\\n\\\\nTitle VII addresses discrimination. . . .

The employer may fire an\\\\nemployee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based an erroneous\\\\nfacts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a\\\\ndiscriminatory reason. While an employer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s judgment or course of action\\\\nmay seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question is simply\\\\nWhether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination.

SMF at HI 23.\\\\nPlaintiff helped others load their cars, and Vice versa. Def. SMF at HI 23. Because\\\\nPlaintiff was allowed to park inside, he would sometimes load oil into his car and\\\\ndrive it to other employees\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 vehicles for them. Def. SMF at HI 23. Plaintiff was\\\\nsometimes too busy with his work duties to load the oil into his car right away, so\\\\nBreeden told him he could stage his oil by the Shipping Department until he was able\\\\nto load it into his vehicle. Def. SMF at HI 24.\\\\n\\\\nOn May 22, 2014, Simmons, the Plant Manager at that time, received a report\\\\nfrom a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9creliable witness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d that he or she had observed Plaintiff \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cstealing jugs of\\\\npackaged oil from Stratas.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Def.

Def. SMF at HI 26. Plaintiff admits that\\\\nDefendant received the report alleging theft of the oil, but claims that all oil Plaintiff\\\\nreceived was paid for. P1. SMF at HI 26; Def. EX. A at 102. Simmons first verified that\\\\nthere had been no employee purchases of oil on the date of the alleged theft, and then\\\\nconfronted Plaintiff about the alleged theft. Def.

Def. SMF at HI 28.\\\\n\\\\nIn July 2015, Metzler and other members of management learned of another\\\\npotential theft of oil and suspicious behavior from Plaintiff and Breeden. Def. SMF\\\\nat HI 29. Metzler found out that Breeden had called people who he believed might have\\\\nreported him, and Metzler was concerned that Breeden was attempting to intimidate\\\\nwitnesses. Def. SMF at HI 30. Therefore, Metzler alerted Corporate Security, and two\\\\ninvestigators were sent to look into the situation. Def. SMF at HI 30. These\\\\ninvestigators met with Breeden and Plaintiff on August 5, 2015 , questioning them\\\\nseparately at the Valdosta Plant. Def. SMF at HI 31.

Def. SMF at HI 32. After Corporate\\\\nSecurity questioned Plaintiff, he was suspended pending further notice. Def. SMF at\\\\nHI 33.

Ms. Lilley does not dispute that\\\\nshe signed the Contract, that a representative from NGS walked her through it, or\\\\nthat the 180-day limitations period in the Contract is reasonable. Plaintiff had an\\\\nadequate opportunity to investigate her Claim and file suit Within the 180\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94day\\\\nperiod outlined in the Contract; all of the facts giving rise to her Claim occurred\\\\n\\\\nbefore her termination; and she filed a charge of discrimination With the EEOC 0n\\\\n\\\\nthe very day of her discharge.

Ms. Lilley alleges that she\\\\nnever received a copy because her address was listed incorrectly 0n the charge,\\\\nand that her counsel never received a copy because the EEOC erroneously did not\\\\n\\\\nassociate him with her case, despite having communicated with him previously.\\\\n\\\\n17Case 1:16-cv-00187-TWT Document 34 Filed 07/18/16 Page 18 of 28\\\\n\\\\n(Li) Plaintiff thus contends that she could not have asserted this Claim earlier\\\\neven With diligence, because she did not receive the RTS Letter due to\\\\ncircumstances beyond her control. (Li. at 5-9.) Inalfa responds that plaintiff was\\\\nnot diligent in pursuing her Title VII Claim and has not shown good cause for her\\\\ndelay because she failed to contact the EEOC to inquire about the RTS Letter\\\\nbefore the amendment deadline and failed to review the address listed on the\\\\ncharge for accuracy. (Def.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Resp. [33] 3-6.) Defendant further argues that\\\\namendment is futile, as plaintiff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Title VII claim is time\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94barred for failure to file\\\\nit within 90 days of receipt of the original RTS Letter.

Although the EEOC Investigator told Ms. Lilley\\\\nto review the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfacts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d section of the form, which she did, he did not mention the\\\\naddress section, so she did not review it.

(Def.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Resp. 4.)

An employee is   xe2  x80  x9cengaged in  ncommerce  xe2  x80  x9d under the FLSA if he or she is:  ndirectly participating in the actual movement of persons or things in  ninterstate commerce by (i) working for an instrumentality of interstate  ncommerce, e. g., transportation or communication industry employees, or  n(ii) by regularly using the instrumentalities of interstate commerce in his  nwork, e.g., regular and recurrent use of interstate telephone, telegraph,  nmails, or travel.25  nThe question, therefore, is Whether the Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 trip to Kentucky qualifies as  n  xe2  x80  x9cregular and recurrent use of interstate . . . travel.  xe2  x80  x9d26 The Court finds that it does not.  nTraveling once to Kentucky to work on a construction proj ect is simply too isolated.27  nThe FLSA  xe2  x80  x99s implementing regulation explains that the typical jobs that involve  n  nregular interstate travel include   xe2  x80  x9ctraveling service men, traveling buyers, traveling  n  nconstruction crews, collectors, and employees of such organizations as circuses,  n  n25 Theme V.

So While the  nPlaintiffs are a construction crew that traveled to another state, the Court is not  nconvinced that the regulation intended a single trip to be sufficient. Moreover, the  nCourt   xe2  x80  x94 through its own research   xe2  x80  x94 was unable to locate a single case that found one  nout-of-state trip to be sufficient.  n  nIn response, the Plaintiffs point to J osendis V. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs,  n  nInc. 29 There, the Eleventh Circuit stated that because the plaintiff   xe2  x80  x9cdid not travel  n  n   n  nacross state lines as part of his work for Wall to Wall, he cannot claim individual  ncoverage based on any of the travel he completed.  xe2  x80  x9d30 The Plaintiffs contend that the  ninverse of the Eleventh Circuit  xe2  x80  x99s statement must then be true.   xe2  x80  x9c[I]f an employee  ncrosses state lines as part of his work, he would be subject to individual coverage  nunder the FLSA.  xe2  x80  x9d31 But the Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 blanket statement contradicts the FLSA  xe2  x80  x99s  nimplementing regulation. The regulation specifically states that the   xe2  x80  x9carea of coverage  n  nin such situations cannot be delimited by any exact formula, since questions of degree  n  n28 29 CPR.   xc2  xa7 776.12.  n29 662 F.3d 1292 (11th Cir. 2011).  n30 La. at 1316.  n  n31 Pls.  xe2  x80  x99 Mot. for Partial Summ.

The relevant case  nlaw is in agreement With the regulation. Courts that have examined the issue have  ndone so on a case-by-case basis. For example, in Bowrin V. Catholic Guardian  nMy, the court found that the plaintiff employees Who traveled out of state weekly  nor two to four times per month established individual coverage, but the plaintiff  nemployees Who traveled out of state only twice in their three years of employment did  nnot establish individual coverage.33 As a result, the Court disagrees With the Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99  ncontention that traveling across state lines automatically qualifies an employee for  nindividual coverage.  n  nThe Court concludes that the Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 Motion for Partial Summary J udgment  n  nregarding the issue of individual coverage should be denied.34 Nevertheless, the Court  n  n32 29 C.F.R.   xc2  xa7 776.12.  n33 417 F.

This lawsuit seeks to recover overtime compensation for Plaintiff and  n  nsimilarly situated employees Who have worked under the title   xe2  x80  x9cAssistant Manager  xe2  x80  x9d  n  nfor WIRELESS VISION.

At all times material to this Complaint, Defendant had two (2) or  nmore employees who regularly sold, handled, or otherwise worked on goods and/or  nmaterials that had been moved in or produced for commerce.  n  n8. Based upon information and belief, the annual gross sales volume of  nDefendant was in excess of $500,000.00 per annum at all times material hereto.  n  n9. At all times pertinent to this Complaint, Defendant was an enterprise  nengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce as de  xef  xac  x81ned by   xc2  xa7  xc2  xa7  n3(r) and 3(s) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 203(r) and 203(s).  n  nPARTIES  n  n10. Plaintiff is an adult individual who is a resident of Decatur, Georgia.  nPlaintiff was employed by Defendant from approximately October 2013 to  nNovember 2014 in Lawrenceville, Gwinnett County, Georgia.  n  n11. Plaintiff is a covered employee within the meaning of the FLSA.  n  n12. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s written consent is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  n  n13. WIRELESS VISION is a Michigan limited liability company with a  nprincipal place of business in Bloom  xef  xac  x81eld Hills, Michigan. At all times material,  nDefendant conducted business in the state of Georgia.  n  n14. WIRELESS VISION is a covered employer within the meaning of the  nFLSA, and, at all times relevant, employed Plaintiff and similarly situated  n  nemployees.  n  nPage-3 -of11Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 4 of 11  n  n15. WIRELESS VISION is the entity listed on Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s paystubs and  nW-ZS.  n  nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  n  n16. During the three (3) year period immediately preceding the   xef  xac  x81ling of  nthis action (  xe2  x80  x9cthe relevant period  xe2  x80  x9d), Defendant employed Plaintiff and similarly  nsituated employees Within the meaning of the FLSA. Defendant has had  nsubstantial control over working conditions of Plaintiff and similarly situated  nemployees, and the unlawful policies and practices alleged herein.  n  n17. WIRELESS VISION regularly required Assistant Managers to work  nin excess of forty (40) hours per week.  n  n18. The primary duties of Assistant Managers are non-exempt, and  ninclude customer service, making sales to customers, and assisting customers With  ntheir service requests.  n  n19. These primary duties do not vary significantly from one WIRELESS  nVISION location to another.  n  n20. The primary duties of Assistant Managers do not fall under any of the  nexemptions under the FLSA.  n  n21. During the relevant period, Plaintiff and similarly situated Assistant  n  nManagers worked over forty (40) hours in one or more work weeks they were  n  nemployed by WIRELESS VISION.  n  nPage-4-of11Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 5 of 11  n  n22. Throughout the relevant period, it has been WIRELESS VISION  xe2  x80  x99s  npolicy to uniformly classify Assistant Managers as exempt from overtime  nprovisions of the FLSA, and not to pay them any overtime wages.  n  n23. During the relevant period, WIRELESS VISION paid its Assistant  nManagers a base weekly salary plus commission, but not time and one-half wages  nfor their hours worked over forty (40) in a work week, Which is a Violation of the  nFLSA.  n  n24. Plaintiff and the putative class members all perform or performed the  nsame primary duties.  n  n25. WIRELESS VISION applies the same employment policies,  npractices, and procedures to all Assistant Managers.  n  n26. WIRELESS VISION did not keep accurate records of hours worked  nby Assistant Managers, including Plaintiff. That is, although Assistant Managers  nroutinely worked more than forty (40) hours, WIRELESS VISION did not record  nthose hours.  n  n27. WIRELESS VISION was aware that Assistant Managers, including  nPlaintiff and the putative class members, worked more than forty (40) hours per  nwork week, yet WIRELESS VISION failed to pay them any overtime compensation  nfor any of the hours worked over forty (40) in a work week.  n  n28. As part of its regular business practice, WIRELESS VISION has  n  nPage-S-ofllCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 6 of 11  n  nintentionally, willfully, and repeatedly engaged in a pattern, practice, and/or policy  nof Violating the FLSA With respect to Plaintiff and the putative class members. This  npolicy and pattern or practice includes, but is not limited to:  n  na. willfully failing to pay Plaintiff and the putative class members  n  novertime wages for hours that they worked in excess of forty  n(40) hours per work week;  n  nb. Will  xef  xac  x81illy misclassifying Plaintiff and the putative class as exempt  nfrom the protections of the FLSA; and  n  nc. willfully failing to record all of the time that its employees,  n  nincluding Plaintiff and the putative class members, have worked  nfor the bene  xef  xac  x81t of WIRELESS VISION.  n  n29. There are many similarly situated current and former Assistant  nManagers Whom have not been paid proper overtime wages in Violation of the  nFLSA and Whom would bene  xef  xac  x81t from the issuance of a court-supervised notice of  nthis lawsuit and the opportunity to join it. Thus, notice should be sent to the  nputative class members pursuant to 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 216(b).  n  n30. The putative class members are known to Defendant, are readily  nidenti  xef  xac  x81able, and can be located through Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s records.  n  n31. By the conduct described in this Complaint, WIRELESS VISION has  nviolated the FLSA by failing to pay Assistant Managers, including Plaintiff and the  nputative class members the overtime wages they have earned and to Which they are  nentitled by law.  n  n32. WIRELESS VISION is aware or should have been aware that the  n  nPage-6-of11Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 7 of 11  n  nFLSA required it to pay employees performing non-exempt duties, including  nPlaintiff and the putative class members, an overtime premium for hours worked in  n  nexcess of forty (40) per work week.  n  n33. WIRELESS VISION  xe2  x80  x99s unlaw  xef  xac  x81il conduct has been Widespread,  nrepeated, and consistent.  n  nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  nFair Labor Standards Act   xe2  x80  x94 Overtime Wages  n  n34. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in 1H] 1  n  nthrough 33.  n  n35. WIRELESS VISION has engaged in a Widespread pattern and  npractice of Violating the FLSA, as described in this Complaint.  n  n36. The overtime wage provisions set forth in   xc2  xa7  xc2  xa7 201 et seq. of the FLSA  napply to WIRELESS VISION.  n  n37. WIRELESS VISION has failed to pay Plaintiff and the putative class  nmembers the overtime wages to Which they were entitled under the FLSA.  n  n38. WIRELESS VISION  xe2  x80  x99s Violations of the FLSA, as described in this  nComplaint, have been willful and intentional.  n  n39. As a result of WIRELESS VISION  xe2  x80  x99s willful Violations of the FLSA,  nPlaintiff and the putative class members have suffered damages by being denied  n  novertime wages in accordance with 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7  xc2  xa7 201 et seq.  n  nPage-7-of11Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404264-AT Document 1 Filed 12/08/15 Page 8 of 11  n  n40.

During his professional  ncareer, Mr. Blalock has, himself, won two Emmy Awards; has played a role in  nCNN earning a national Emmy  xc2  xae Award for coverage of the Egyptian Revolution  nin February 201 1; and has played an even bigger role in earning the network a  nnational Emmy  xc2  xae Award nomination, as writer/producer 0n the CNN News Room  nwith Suzanne Malveaux program.  n  n2.  n  n  xe2  x80  x98No good deed goes unpunished  xe2  x80  x99 however, because despite Mr. Blalock  xe2  x80  x99s  nindividual and team success as an employee of Defendants, these Defendants have  nintentionally and wilfully violated Mr. Blalock  xe2  x80  x99s right to be free from race  xe2  x80  x94based  ndiscrimination in his employment.  n  n3.  n  nDefendants have discriminated against Mr. Blalock through a discriminatory  nschematic that allows Caucasians to receive   xe2  x80  x9con the job training,  xe2  x80  x9d which is training  nthat occurs during work hours so that Caucasian employees who receive said  ntraining are paid while training.

As a matter of fact,  nif on the job training is denied, then opportunity for advancement in the form of  ngreater compensation and increased prestige (job title) is also denied.  n  n29.  n  nBelieving he was being discriminated against, Mr. Blalock spoke to several  n  nother African  xe2  x80  x94American employees in the newsroom and found on multiple  n  noccasions Defendants routinely denied African Americans an opportunity to train  n  n-11....Case 1:15-cv-O4298  xe2  x80  x94MHC Document 1 Filed 12/10/15 Page 12 of 18  n  nfor higher  xe2  x80  x94ranked positions, putting Plaintiff and other A  xef  xac  x81ican-Amet  xe2  x80  x98ican  nemployees at an economic disadvantage.  n30.  n  nIn multiple employment contexts within Defendants  xe2  x80  x9d company where Mr.  nBlalock works, Defendants denied   xe2  x80  x9con the job training  xe2  x80  x9d to African-Americans, and  nmany of these African-Americans simply resigned to pursue their professional  nambitions in non-discriminatory environments.  n  nE.

xe2  x80  x99s duties included driving a tractor~trailer truck making deliveries  nand loading and unloading freight.  n26.  nIn order to drive a tractor-trailer, Plaintiff obtained a CDL license.  n27.  nA few months into her employment, Plaintiff switched to driving a straight  ntruck, but was still performing the same job duties.  n28.  nIn or around November 21, 2012, the VP of Air Freight, Royce Aultman,  ntold Plaintiff that one of her customers, DHL, wanted to cut hours.  n29.  nMr. Aultman told Plaintiff that she was being let go because she could not  n  ndrive a tractor-trailer and was part-time.Case 1:15-cv-04353  xe2  x80  x94SCJ Document 1 Filed 12/15/15 Page 7 of 14  n  n30.  nPlaintiff told Aultman that she had her CDL license and could drive a  ntractor-trailer and was fully qualified.  n31.  nAt the time, Plaintiff was working from 6:00 am. until 7:00 p.m., and was  ntherefore a full time driver.  n32.  nPlaintiff also contacted DHL and in Aultman  xe2  x80  x99s presence, DHL denied  ndemanding Plaintiff termination.  n33.  nDHL  xe2  x80  x99s representative stated that DHL wanted to keep Plaintiff as a senior  ndriver.  n34.  nIn response, Aultman told Plaintiff that she would have to pass a road test  nbefore she could drive a tractor  xe2  x80  x94trailer.  n35.  nWhen Plaintiff drove the tractor-trailer for the test, it had a trailer attached,  n  ncontrary to claims made by Respondent to the EEOC.  n  n36.Case 1:15-cv-04353-SCJ Document 1 Filed 12/15/15 Page 8 of 14  n  nPlaintiff took the road test under the supervision of Willie Garner.  n  n37.  nGarner told Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s supervisor, in her presence, that she had passed.  n38.  n  nThe same day Plaintiff took the road test, she learned that the other four  nmale drivers were not chosen for termination and that they were given an option to  nwork at a different building.  n  n39.  n  nOn November 23, 2012, Plaintiff told Aultman that she had passed the road  n  ntest.  n40.  nAultman stated that he was thinking of using Plaintiff on Saturdays and  n  nSundays.  n  n41.  n  nHowever, when Plaintiff showed up for work, Aultman told the supervisor to  nsend Plaintiff home.  n42.  nWhen Plaintiff called Aultman on November 27, 2012 to ask when she could  n  ncome back to work, he told her he would call her back \"in 15 minutes.\"  n  n43.Case 1:15-cv-04353-SCJ Document 1 Filed 12/15/15 Page 9 of 14  n  nPlaintiff never heard back from Autumn or anyone else regarding returning  n  nto work.  n44.  n  nDefendants gave the EEOC false and pretextual reasons for terminating  nPlaintiff, to wit:  n  nThe Respondent alleged that though your Client had a CDL license,  nher last experience with large units was in 2004, and Respondent   \\'s  ninsurance carrier would not have accepted her as a tractor trailer  ndriver. The Respondent alleged that when determining lay-offs and  ncutting their night shift from 7 to 2 employees, they considered  nemployee status (full-time or part-time) and if they qualified for  nanother position. The Respondent alleged that your Client was part-  ntime and she did not qualify to drive the larger tractor trailer units.  nFurthermore, Willie Garner alleged that when your Client took the  nroad test, she was driving on a Sunday, with good weather, and no  ntrailer. Respondent stated that in Mr. Garner   \\'s opinion, your Client  nwould be considered a safety hazard and he did not recommend that  nshe operate a loaded tractor.  n  nThese claims are false.  n  n45.  n  nIn fact, as Mr. Garner testified in a sworn Declaration under penalty of  nperjury in July of 2014, at Mr. Aultman  xe2  x80  x99s request, he gave a road test to Plaintiff  nto see if she could safely drive a tractor-trailer.  n  n46.  nWhen Mr. Garner gave Plaintiff the test, she drove a tractor-trailer with the  n  ntrailer attached.Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404353-SCJ Document 1 Filed 12/15/15 Page 10 of 14  n  n47.  n  nPlaintiff passed the test and Mr. Gamer felt that she was very capable of  n  nsafely driving a loaded tractor-trailer.  n  n48.  nImmediately after the test, Mr. Garner told Mr. Aultman that Plaintiff passed  nthe test.  n49.  nMr. Gamer never told Mr. Aultman that Plaintiff was a safety risk. Mr.  n  nGamer wouldn  xe2  x80  x99t have said that about Plaintiff because he did not believe it was  n  ntrue.  n  n50.  n  nMr. Garner  xe2  x80  x99s Sworn Declaration is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  n  nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS  nCOUNT ONE:  nSEX DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF TITLE VII  n  n5 1 .  n  nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this  n  nComplaint as fully set forth herein.  n52.  n  nDefendants terminated Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s employment because of her sex, female, in \\' r nb\"Case 1:15-cv-04379-MHC Document 1 Filed 12/16/15 Page 1 of 14  n  nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA  nATLANTA DIVISION  n  nKELLI J OHNSON  nPlaintiff,  n  nQ  n9  xe2  x80  x99  n2  ne  n  nV.  n  nD.

Out of an abundance of caution, the Court assumes  n  nthat the Counterclaims were brought by all Defendants.  n  n2Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 56 Filed 02/22/17 Page 3 of 8  n  ncounterclaimed against Garmon for: (1) conversion, (2) breach of  ncontract, (3) invasion of privacy, (4) defamation, (5) intentional  ninfliction. of emotional distress, and (6) attorneys  xe2  x80  x99 fees and  nexpenses (lg; at 53  xe2  x80  x9459].

In his Reply, Garmon argues that summary judgment is  nappropriate on all claims and counterclaims because Defendants have  nfailed to adequately respond to his Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc.  n47 at 2  xe2  x80  x947]. Garmon further argues that Corporate Defendants should  nbe defaulted for failure to obtain counsel [;g; at 7  xe2  x80  x948].  n  nUnder the Local Rules, unless the respondent specifically objects  nor counters, the Court admits material facts a movant alleges in  nsupport of a motion for summary judgment, and finds them supported by  nthe evidence the movant Cites.

Procedural Background  n  nOn December 17, 2015 Andrew Garmon filed this case against his  nformer employers Emmett Lamar Seals, III (hereinafter   xe2  x80  x9cSeals  xe2  x80  x9d), Tuff  nTV Media Group, LLC, Tuff TV Worldwide, Inc., and Seals Entertainment  nCompany, LLC (hereinafter collectively   xe2  x80  x9cCorporate Defendants\") [Doc.  n1]. The Complaint was properly served on all Defendants [Docs. 3, 4,  n  n5, 6]. On January 28, 2016 Garmon filed a First Amended Complaint  n  n[Doc. 9], which was served on all Defendants [;g; at 31]. Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s  nFirst .Amended Complaint. brought. claims for: (1) non  xe2  x80  x94payment (of  novertime wages under the Fair  xe2  x80  x98 Labor  xe2  x80  x9c Standards .Act (FLSA)H (2)  nnegligent hiring, supervision, and retention, (3) intentional  n  ninfliction of emotional distress, (4) battery, (5) assault, (6) false  n  nlAlthough the First Amended Complaint indicates that this FLSA  nclaim is brought on behalf of   xe2  x80  x9cPlaintiff and the Collective Classes\"  n[Doc. 9 at 11], the Court finds no evidence of a class on behalf of  nwhich Plaintiff brought suit. The Court therefore finds that  nPlaintiff is suing solely on his own behalf.Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 2 of 8  n  nimprisonment, and (7) retaliation in violation of the FLSA.  nPlaintiff also seeks an award of attorneys  xe2  x80  x99 fees and expenses and  npunitive damages [;g; at 11  xe2  x80  x9428].  n  nOn February 16, 2016 Seals and Corporate Defendants filed an  nAnswer to Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s First Amended Complaint and Counterclaims against  nGarmon [Doc. 12]. Seals and Corporate Defendants counterclaimed  nagainst Garmon for: (1) conversion, (2) breach of contract, (3)  ninvasion of privacy, (4) defamation, (5) intentional infliction of  nemotional distress, and (6) attorneys  xe2  x80  x99 fees and expenses [LQ1 at 53-  n59] .  n  nOn December 23, 2016 Garmon filed a Motion for Summary Judgment  nseeking summary judgment as to all claims and counterclaims [Doc.  n40], whr  xef  xac  x82l was served CH1 all Defendants [Doc. 41]. Defendants  nresponded [Doc. 42], and Garmon replied [Doc. 47]. On February 22,  n2017 this Court issued an Order finding that Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 Response did  nnot specifically object to or counter any of the material facts in  nGarmon   \\'s Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 56 at 5]. Based on those  nmaterial facts, Garmon was entitled to summary judgment. The Court  ngranted Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s Motion for Summary Judgment as to all claims and  ncounterclaims in the case [lgL].2  n  nAn evidentiary hearing regarding damages was held on March 30,  n  n2017. Plaintiff Garmon, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s witness William Wagner, and  n  nDefendant Seals were sworn and testified [Doc. 65]. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  n  n2After granting a Motion to Withdraw by then  xe2  x80  x94counsel for all  nDefendants [Doc. 31], this Court clarified that Corporate Defendants  n  nmust obtain new counsel to represent them [Doc. 32]. Corporate  nDefendants did not obtain new counsel and were unrepresented at the  nMarch 30 hearing. Defendant Seals represented himself at the  nhearing.Case 1:15-cv-04394  xe2  x80  x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 3 of 8  n  nExhibits 1-3 were admitted [Doc. 66]. In. closing, Plaintiff   \\'s  ncounsel requested the Court award Garmon $6,000 on his FLSA overtime  nClaim ($3,000 in actual damages and $3,000 in liquidated damages),  nand between $150,000 and $200,000 on his tort claims, plus attorneys   \\'  n  nfees and costs under the FLSA and Georgia law. Accordingly, this  n  nmatter is now before the Court.  n  nII. Discussion  n  nFrom approximately November 6, 2014 to November 2, 2015 Garmon  nwas jointly employed by Corporate Defendants and their Chief  nExecutive Officer (CEO), Seals [Doc. 67 at 2 (citing Doc. 40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 2)].  nCorporate Defendants are in the business of distributing television  ncontent, and make money by selling advertising space [chleL at 3  n(citing Doc. 40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 4)]. Defendants Tuff TV Media Group and Tuff TV  nWorldwide are subsidiaries of Defendant Seals Entertainment [;g; at  n2 (citing Doc. 40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 3)]. Defendant Seals was CEO of all Corporate  nDefendants, controlling and directing all Corporate Defendants [lg  xc3  xa9  nat 3 (citing Doc. 40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 5)].  n  nGarmon   \\'s title was Coordinator of Programming and Promotions, a  njob which included scheduling the TV programming Corporate Defendants  ndistributed, updating company   \\' websites and Facebook pages, and  nhandling administrative tasks [LQL at 3-4 (citing Doc. 40-3   xef  xac  x82 16)].  nSeals assigned Garmon   \\'s job duties, controlled his performance, and  nreviewed and approved Garmon   \\'s work [Doc. 40-2   xef  xac  x82 18 (citing Doc. 40-3  n  xef  xac  x82 18)]. Seals also controlled Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s hours [lg;   xef  xac  x82 19 (citing Doc.  n40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 19)]. Defendants paid Garmon an hourly wage [Doc. 67 at 4  n(citing Damages Hearing Garmon Testimony (hereinafter   xe2  x80  x9cGarmon  nTest.  xe2  x80  x9d))]. Garmon did not manage, hire, or fire employees, and his  n  nincome did not vary based upon exercising managerial skill [Doc. 40-2  n  n3Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 4 of 8  n  n  xef  xac  x82 20 (citing Doc. 40-3   xef  xac  x82 20)]. Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s job did not require  xe2  x80  x94  xe2  x80  x94and he  ndid not have  xe2  x80  x94-any specialized training or skills [lg  xc3  xa9   xef  xac  x82 21 (citing  nDoc. 40  xe2  x80  x943 1] 21)]. During his employment with Defendants, that  nposition was Garmon   \\'s sole employment and sole source of income LLQ;  n  xef  xac  x82 22 (citing Doc. 40-3   xef  xac  x82 22)]. Throughout his employment, Garmon   \\'s  nonly office was a room in Defendant Seals   \\' residence [Doc. 67 at 4  n(citing Doc. 40-3 1 23, Doc. 40-4   xef  xac  x82 4)].  n  nDuring the first seven weeks of Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s employment, through  nDecember 27, 2014, Garmon was paid a regular rate of $10.00 per hour  n[;g; (citing Garmon Test.)]. From November 9, 2014 to December 27,  n2014 Garmon worked approximately 46 hours per week [lgA (citing  nGarmon Test.)]. From December 28, 2014 to the end of his employment,  nGarmon was paid a regular rate of $12.00 per hour [;g; at 5 (citing  nGarmon Test.)]. From December 28, 2014 through March 28, 2015 Garmon  nworked approximately 60 hours per week for ten of those weeks, and  napproximatelyr 46 hours per   \\' week. the remaining   \\' three   xe2  x80  x98weeks [;g;  n(citing Garmon Test.)]. From March 29, 2015 through October 17, 2015  nGarmon worked a total of 247 overtime hours [;g; (citing Garmon  nTBst.)]. Defendants knew of and/or approved the overtime hours  nGarmon worked [;g; at 6 (citing Doc. 40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 30)]. At no time during  nGarmon  xe2  x80  x99s employment did Defendants ever pay Garmon one-and a  xe2  x80  x94half  ntimes his regular pay rate for his overtime hours; he only ever  nearned his regular pay rate for overtime hours [l  xef  xac  x81L at 5 (citing  nGarmon Test.)].  n  nIn summary, Garmon is owed $3,000 in overtime pay. The Court  nassesses an additional award of $3,000 in liquidated damages.  n  nTurning to the other claims, the evidence shows that during the  n  none year period of Garmon   \\'s employment Seals  xe2  x80  x99 treatment of him was  n  n4Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 5 of 8  n  nabusive and controlling to a pathological degree. Seals admits that  nhe has an anger management problem for which he has sought treatment.  nSeals frequently screamed at Garmon, in whom he did not have much  nconfidence and vented his anger by issuing commands and comments  nwhich frequently were demeaning. The evidence depicted Garmon as an  nemotionally fragile person who found it difficult to cope with Seals  xe2  x80  x99  naggressive manner. Seals understood Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s fragility. Seals  xe2  x80  x99  nabuse of Garmon took the form of screaming at him, threatening him,  ninsisting that Garmon participate in unwelcome sexual activity, and  nmaking sexual jokes and comments at Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s expense. Garmon was  nafraid of Seals.  n  nThe Court accepts Seals  xe2  x80  x99 testimony that his treatment of Garmon  nwas not uniformly negative. Specifically, when Garmon threatened to  ncommit suicide Seals called the United Way Suicide Hotline and  nobtained counseling for Garmon. He also kept Garmon on as an  nemployee although he felt Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s performance was inadequate. He  ntold Garmon he could take time off to look for a new job, if he  nwanted to so do. On one evening, Seals was contacted by police  nconcerning Garmon. Garmon had gone to meet another man for a   xe2  x80  x9csexual  nhookup  xe2  x80  x9d; the other man.was involved in illegal drugs and was arrested  nat the scene by police. Garmon was not arrested; Seals went to get  nGarmon and took him home. Garmon and Seals frequently went out to  nlunch together; Seals always paid the bill.  n  nGarmon credibly testified that Seals required him.to participate  nin some sexual activity despite his objection. He testified that  n  nSeals required him to provide oral sex at least 15 times, purportedly  nto relieve Seals  xe2  x80  x99 stress and that Seals required him, three or four  n  ntimes, to shave   xe2  x80  x9cevery inch  xe2  x80  x9d of Seals  xe2  x80  x99 body. The Court accepts  n  n5Case 1:15-cv-04394  xe2  x80  x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 6 of 8  n  nGarmon   \\'s testimony that Seals threatened to tell Garmon   \\'s grandfather  nthat Garmon was gay if he did not provide oral sex to Seals.  n  nIn addition, the Court accepts other testimony by Garmon as  nfollows.  n  nSeals participated. in. numerous group texts with. other   \\' men  naffiliated with the Corporate Defendants. Garmon was also included.  nThese texts sometimes demeaned Garmon. For example, Seals texted  nthat Garmon had   xe2  x80  x9c  xe2  x80  x98demon seed,   \\'  xe2  x80  x9d wore diapers, was a   xe2  x80  x9c  xe2  x80  x98stud,  xe2  x80  x99\" and was  n  xe2  x80  x9c[good at] sliding   xe2  x80  x98his sausage   \\' in  xe2  x80  x9d [Doc. 67 at 10 (citing Doc. 40-3  n  nW 42, Garmon Test., Doc. 66-1)]. Seals also sent the group a picture  n  nof someone   \\'s naked buttocks, and texted   xe2  x80  x9c  xe2  x80  x98Andrew cries and asks  nvendors to f**k him even harder  xe2  x80  x99  xe2  x80  x9d [Id. at 10  xe2  x80  x9411 (citing Doc. 40-3  nW 42, Garmon Test., Doc. 66-1)]. On or around June 4, 2015 in  n  nanother group text with the same group, the CFO   \\'s brother texted a  npicture of movie theater seats that had penises sticking out of them;  nSeals replied   xe2  x80  x9c  xe2  x80  x98Why is Andrew not seating [sic.] in one of those  nchairs?   \\'  xe2  x80  x9d [;g; at 11 (citing Doc. 40-3 W 44, Garmon Test., Doc. 66  xe2  x80  x94  n1)]. Another time, Seals texted Garmon a picture of a person   \\'s bare  nbuttocks with a pitchfork shoved through them and a message stating  n  xe2  x80  x9c  xe2  x80  x98This is what I am going to do to you on Halloween!!   \\'  xe2  x80  x9d [lgA at 10  n(citing Doc. 40-3 W 41, Garmon Test., Doc. 66  xe2  x80  x941)].  n  nThe evidence which is most influential in awarding damages is a  nvideo recording made by Garmon without Seals   \\' knowledge on  nNovember 2, 2015. On that morning, Seals (who was in the shower)  nreceived a cell phone call from a client who wanted to know what was  nthe problem with the company   \\'s land line. The client had been trying  nto reach Seals through the company land line and evidently had been  n  ntold that the telephone number was not in service. Seals was  n  n6Case 1:15-cv-04394  xe2  x80  x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 7 of 8  n  nembarrassed. He blamed the failure to pay the telephone bill on  nGarmon. Seals flew into a rage, essentially cornering Garmon in the  nroom connecting to the shower. Seals continually barked out orders  nto Garmon to get the telephone company on the line and get the line  nreconnected. However, Garmon was terrified by Seals  xe2  x80  x99 anger and  nthreatening demeanor and was tongue  xe2  x80  x94tied. All of the foregoing is  ncaptured on the video. Seals dismisses the video as   xe2  x80  x9ca setup,\" but  nSeals   \\' actions certainly are accurately captured. While Seals  ntemporarily blocked the door to the room so that Garmon could not  nleave, that only lasted a few minutes. Garmon worked at the office  nfor the rest of that day. However, when he left that evening he  nresolved not to and did not return.  n  nDuring his employment Garmon had difficulty sleeping at night  nbecause he was worried about what might happen at work the next day  n[Doc. 67 at 14 (citing Doc. 40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 52, Garmon Test.)]. At work,  nGarmon was stressed, never knowing what Seals might do next, and when  nSeals did act out, Garmon was humiliated [;g; at 14-15 (citing Doc.  n40  xe2  x80  x943   xef  xac  x82 52, Garmon Test.)]. Near the end of his employment, Garmon  nwould go home crying at night [Garmon Test., Wagner Test.]. Garmon  nlost approximately 25 pounds during the one year term of his  nemployment. .lg; He became nervous and apprehensive. He has sought  ntherapy.  n  nIn assessing damages, the Court considers that Garmon.could.have  nleft his employment with Defendants long before he did; certainly,  nwithin four months of beginning work Garmon knew the score concerning  nthe work environment. Garmon   \\'s explanation that he could not leave  nearlier because he was supporting his mother and sister is  n  nunconvincing. The Court does not reject his testimony that he sent  n  n7Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 8 of 8  n  nmoney to his mother and sister, but does question his assertion that  nthis made it impossible for him to leave. He could have looked for  nanother job. This has a big impact on awardable damages.  n  nLeaving aside the FLSA claims, the damages award on Garmon  xe2  x80  x99s  nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress subsumes the  ndamages awardable on all other claims (battery, negligent hiring,  nassault, false imprisonment). One award of compensatory damages will  nbe made on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and  nno additional damages will be awarded on the other state law claims.  nDamages are awarded, as follows: $6,000 on the overtime claim under  nthe Fair Labor Standards Act but zero dollars for the retaliation  nclaim under the FLSA; $25,000 compensatory damages on the intentional  ninfliction of emotional distress claim, no additional compensatory  ndamages on the battery, negligent hiring, assault and false  nimprisonment claims, $10,000 punitive damages on the claim for  nintentional infliction of emotional distress. Should Plaintiff wish  nto seek an award of attorneys  xe2  x80  x99 fees his application must be filed  nwithin ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Order. Defendant  nmay file opposition within twenty (20) days of the date of entry of  nthis Order.

The unlawful acts  nagainst Plaintiff occurred in this judicial district and division. In addition,  nPlaintiff resides in this judicial district and division and the Defendant  noperates their business in this judicial district and division.  n  n6.  n  nPare is an enterprise subject to the FLSA because it does at least  n  n$500,000 in business, is engaged in interstate commerce, and has at least two  n  nemployees.  n  nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  n7.  nPlaintiff Keith Robinson was hired by Defendant as a Sous Chef on or  nabout February 28, 2012.  n8.  n  nAs a Sous Chef, Robinson was initially paid an annual salary of  n  n$40,000.Case 1:15-cv-O4401-TWT Document 1 Filed 12/17/15 Page 4 of 9  n  n9.  n  nUntil on or about J anuary 12, 2013, Pare improperly classified  n  nRobinson as exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA.  n10.  n  nEven though he was on salary and worked in excess of fifty hours per  nweek, Pare would require him to take vacation in full day increments even  nthough he did not take near a full day off.  n  n11.  n  nEven though Robinson reported his hours and regularly worked (and  nreported working) over fifty hours per week, Pare recorded that he only  nworked 40 hours per week.  n  n12.  n  nPare did not pay Robinson overtime as a Sous Chef for work performed  n  nfrom February 28, 2012 though J anuary 12, 2013.  n13.  nOn or about February 13, 2013, Pare reclassified the Sous Chef position  n  nas non-exempt and began to pay Robinson an hourly wage of $16.01 per hour.Case 1:15-cv-O4401-TWT Document 1 Filed 12/17/15 Page 5 0f 9  n  n14.  nDespite realizing that Robinson had been improperly classified as  nexempt from the beginning of his employment, Pare did not offer to pay  n  nRobison for the overtime he had not been paid since February 28, 2012.  n  n15.  nHowever, Pare only paid Robinson overtime for hours worked in excess  nof fifty hours per week even though he regularly worked in excess of fifty  n  nhours per week.  n  n16.  n  nOn or about April 7, 2013, Robinson was promoted to Executive Chef.  n17.  n  nAs an Executive Chef, Pare initially paid Robinson an hourly wage of  n  n$21.63 per hour and classified his as non-exempt.  n  n18.  nAs an Executive Chef classified as non-exempt, Pare only paid  n  nRobinson for overtime for hours worked in excess of fifty hours per week.  n19.  n  nOn or about J une 1, 2013, Pare reclassified the Executive Chef position  n  nas exempt.Case 1:15-cv-O4401-TWT Document 1 Filed 12/17/15 Page 6 0f 9  n  n20.  n  nParc did not pay Robinson overtime as an Executive Chef for work  n  nperformed from June 1, 2013 until his employment ended.  n21.  n  nAs either a Sous Chef or an Executive Chef, Robinson did not meet the  nprofessional exemption under the FLSA because Robinson did not have any  nadvanced culinary training and such training was not required or used as his  nprimary duties. Instead, Robinson  xe2  x80  x99s primary duties were to prepare recipes  nthat were already available just as other kitchen staff did.  n  n22.  n  nAs either a Sous Chef or an Executive Chef, Robinson did not meet the  nexecutive chef exemption under the FLSA because he rarely, if ever,  nsupervised other employees. Rather the bulk of his duties were cooking and  npreparing food.  n  n23.  n  nAs either a Sous Chef or an Executive Chef, Robinson did not have the  n  nauthority to hire, fire, promote, or discipline employees and any opinions he  n  nhad on such decisions were not given particular weight.Case 1:15-cv-O4401-TWT Document 1 Filed 12/17/15 Page 7 of 9  n  n24.  nJust as when he was misclassified as exempt as a Sous Chef, even  nthough Robinson was on salary and worked in excess of fifty hours per week,  n  nPare would require him to take vacation in full day increments even though  n  nhe did not take near a full day off.  n  nCOUNT ONE  nFAILURE TO OVERTIME UNDER THE FLSA.  n  n25.  nPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the  npreceding paragraphs of his Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  n26.  nDefendant violated the FLSA by failing to pay Plaintiff overtime for  ntime worked in excess of forty hours per week.  n27.  nDefendant knew or should have known that such actions Violate the  nFLSA, and they did not made a good faith effort to comply with the FLSA.  n28.  nDefendants knowingly, willfully, and/or With reckless disregard, failed  n  nto pay Plaintiff such overtime.Case 1:15-cv-O4401-TWT Document 1 Filed 12/17/15 Page 8 0f 9  n  n29.  n  nAs a result of Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s unlawful acts, Plaintiff is entitled to recover  nthe relief requested below.  n  nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays:  na.

 xc2  xa7 1331 and 29  nU.S.C.   xc2  xa7 621 et seq.  n3.  nThis Court is a proper venue for Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 claims under 28 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 1391  nbecause the events complained of occurred Within the geographic boundaries in the  n  nNorthern District of Georgia  n  nPARTIES  n4.  nPlaintiff is a citizen of the United States and resided in the Northern District  nof Georgia during the discriminatory activity.  n5.  n  nPlaintiff was over the age of 40 at the time of the adverse employment actions  ncomplained of herein  n6.  nAt all times pertinent to this lawsuit, Defendant has been engaged in an industry  naffecting commerce Within the meaning of Section 11(h) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C.  n  n  xc2  xa7 630(h).Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404424-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/21/15 Page 11 of 18  n  nBeginning around 2012, Plaintiff was asked frequently what Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s plans  nwere for the next year and when was Plaintiff going to retire, and if anyone could  nhelp Plaintiff find a position in a different department.  n  n53.  n  nAfter Plaintiff responded in an ambiguous manner, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s supervisor  nbegan issuing bogus write-ups to Plaintiff for incidents which did not occur, and  nmade baseless allegations regarding Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s job performance.  n  n54.  n  nAfter each write-up, performance discussion, or coaching, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s  nsupervisor would ask Plaintiff when Plaintiff was going to retire, and what Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s  nplans were for the next year, trying to prompt Plaintiff to say that Plaintiff would  nretire.  n  n55.  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s supervisor pressured Plaintiff to give a speci  xef  xac  x81c retirement date, but  nPlaintiff would not.  n  n56.  n  nThe frequent comments by Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s supervisor that Plaintiff should retire  nresulted in Plaintiff receiving less opportunity for advancement and less training than  n  nother employees.Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404424-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/21/15 Page 12 of 18  n  n57.  n  nThe frequent comments about Plaintiff retiring also caused other employees  nto disregard Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s suggestions, requests, and to exclude Plaintiff in the  nworkplace, Which impeded Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s ability to perform her job.  n  n58.  n  nDefendant and Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s supervisor knew that Plaintiff did not know how to  nplace   xe2  x80  x9c  xef  xac  x82ags  xe2  x80  x9d on patient   xef  xac  x81les and Plaintiff had never received any training on placing  npatient   xef  xac  x82ags on   xef  xac  x81les, and the allegation that Plaintiff placed a   xe2  x80  x9c  xef  xac  x82ag  xe2  x80  x9d on her own  nrecords was pretext for illegal discrimination against Plaintiff because of her age.  n  n59.  n  nThe termination of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s employment was pretext for illegal  n  ndiscrimination against Plaintiff 0n the basis of her age.  n60.  n  nDefendant discriminated against Plaintiff due to her age, in Violation of the  nADEA, 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7  xc2  xa7 621 et seq., and caused Plaintiff damages in an amount to be  nproved at trial.  n  n61.  n  nThe Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s discriminatory and retaliatory acts were willful Within the  n  nmeaning of the ADEA and FMLA, and Plaintiff is entitled to liquidated damages  n  narising from such Violations.Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404424-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/21/15 Page 13 of 18  n  n62.  n  nPlaintiff timely filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal

xe2  x80  x9404424-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/21/15 Page 15 of 18  n  n73.  n  nPlaintiff, however, exercised her rights under the FMLA in taking time off  nWhen incapacitated due to her serious medical condition, and requesting time off for  ntreatment and diagnosis of her serious health condition.  n  n74.  n  nAs a result of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s use and requests for leave, Defendant

preceding paragraphs.  n77.  n  nPlaintiff engaged in or in good faith believed that she was engaging in  n  nstatutorily protected activity When she requested FMLA leave for her serious  n  nmedical

nemployment Within a few weeks after Plaintiff requested and attempted to exercise  nher right to leave under the FMLA.  n  n79.  n  nDefendant terminated Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s employment because

limited to lost wages, lost benefits, financial liability for medical  nprocedures Which would have been covered by Defendant Employer  xe2  x80  x99s health  ninsurance program, and other damages.  n  n81.  n  nDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s unlawful termination of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s employment to retaliate  nagainst Plaintiff for requesting and taking FMLA leave was willful entitling Plaintiff

This case is before the Court on Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary judgment  non all claims.

[Doc. 32.]  n  nThe first count of Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s amended complaint is brought under Title  nVII. [Doc. 22 at 6.] Willocks alleges that she was in the following three  nprotected classes: a Hispanic individual from Panama; black; and being from  nPanama and having an accent. [Id.] She alleges that Kindred discriminated  nagainst her because of her race, color, and/or national origin in firing her, and that  nits motivation in firing her was, in whole or in part, based on those three factors.  n[Id. at 7.] Willocks further alleges that Kindred retaliated against her for refusing  nto participate in its scheme to systematically force older Hispanic employees to  n  nquit 0r retire.

[Doc. 36-5 ][ 24.] Schmitt further  nstated that the reasons for firing Willocks were the suspected falsification of  ndocuments and the failure to follow Harrilson  xe2  x80  x99s directive to give her the  ndocumentation before giving it to the auditor. [Doc. 36-4 ][ 16.] Schmitt and  nGibson also both stated that neither spoke with Hoffmann concerning Willocks or  nthe issues related to her termination. [Id. ][ 20; Doc. 36-5 ][ 30.]4  n  nE.

[Id.] Willocks admits that she did not complain to anyone about  nbeing mistreated on account of her disability, and she admits that none of the  npeople who decided to fire her were aware of Willocks having requested any  naccommodation. [Doc. 36-8 M 77-78.]  nIll. Evidentiary Rulings  n  nIn its reply brief, Kindred objects wholesale t0 the consideration of two  npieces of evidence submitted along with Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s response to Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s motion  nfor summary judgment. [See Doc. 39 at 4-8.] Specifically, it objects to Exhibit A  nof Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s declaration and Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s declaration. [Id.] Before addressing the  n  nmerits of the case, I will address each evidentiary objection in turn.  n  n5 The statement of material facts states that this date was in 2014, but that  nappears to be a typographical error.  n  n12Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 13 of 45  n  nA. Exhibit A to Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s declaration is probative of none of  nWillocks  xe2  x80  x99s arguments, and therefore will not be considered in  nmy analysis of the summary judgment motion.  n  nExhibit A of Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s declaration is a two-page printout detailing an  nanonymous December 2011 phone call complaining of discrimination at Kindred.  n[Doc. 38-3 at 9-10.] The report details that an anonymous caller complained that  ntwo employees  xe2  x80  x94Jamila Blossomgame and Patricia Brown  xe2  x80  x94were unprofessional  nand were singling out older employees for firing. [Id. at 9.] The caller also stated  nthat those two employees were singling out Willocks for termination. [Id.] The  ndocument also contains notes on the investigation into the complaints,  npresumably by human resources, and each complaint was found to be  nunsubstantiated. [Id. at 9-10.]  n  nNothing on the face of the document makes clear who created the  ndocument or what entity maintained the document. [See Doc. 38-3 at 9-10.]  nLikewise, Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s declaration does not purport to state anything about the  ndocument  xe2  x80  x99s creation or maintenance. [See id. at 3-7.] The only reference to  nExhibit A in Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s declaration appears to be paragraph 15, where Willocks  n  nrelies on the document to state that somebody filed a complaint with Kindred in  n  nDecember 2011 regarding age discrimination. [Id. HI 15 .]  n  n13Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 14 of 45  n  nKindred makes three arguments as to why Exhibit A should be stricken.  nSpecifically, it argues that (1) the document is not authenticated; (2) the document  nwas not produced during discovery despite being responsive to discovery  nrequests; and (3) the exhibit is based, in large part, on inadmissible hearsay. [Doc.  n39 at 4  xe2  x80  x946.]  n  nBased on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s response brief, she appears to be putting forth the  nexhibit as evidence related to her retaliation claim. [See Doc. 38 at 7, 9.] She  nargues that it is relevant that she was discriminated against shortly after the  npurported age discrimination scheme was reported to the Kindred hotline, [id. at  n7], and that the exhibit is relevant to show that Willocks opposed the purported  nscheme, [id. at 9].  n  nEven accepting the document as properly authenticated and otherwise  nadmissible, it is not at all clear how the challenged exhibit could support any of  nWillocks  xe2  x80  x99s contentions unless Willocks herself placed the phone call to Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s  nhotline and that someone at Kindred was aware of that fact. Nothing in the record  nsupports either proposition. Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s own declaration states, in reference to the  ndocument, that   xe2  x80  x9csomeone called Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s complaint line.  xe2  x80  x9d [Doc. 38-3 at 4.] I  n  ntherefore find it unnecessary to decide whether Exhibit A should be stricken as  n  n14Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 15 of 45  n  ninadmissible at trial. As it is probative of none of the arguments advanced by  nWillocks, the document Will simply not add anything to my analysis.  n  nB. The bulk of the statements in Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s declaration are  ninadmissible as being beyond the scope of the witness  xe2  x80  x99s  ncompetency.  n  nKindred also argues that the Thigpen declaration is inadmissible. [Doc. 39  nat 6-8.] Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s argument on this point is a bit scattershot, alternatively  nasserting that the declaration is irrelevant, hearsay, and impermissible 1ay opinion  ntestimony, Without developing or separating those contentions. [See id.]  n  nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states that, in order to be considered in  nsupport or opposition to a motion, a declaration   xe2  x80  x9cmust be made on personal  nknowledge.  xe2  x80  x9d Fed. R. CiV. P. 56(c)(4). It makes sense that a party cannot create a  nfactual issue by having a Witness make a statement that is outside the scope of his  npersonal knowledge, and the principle excluding such evidence is not a new one.  nSee Cha  xef  xac  x82ee & Co. v. United States, 85 US. 516, 543 (1873). Accordingly, a  n  ndeclaration that a Witness   xe2  x80  x9cbelieves  xe2  x80  x9d a fact to be true is typically insufficient to  n  ncreate a genuine issue as to the existence of that fact. See Pace v. Capobianco,  n  n283 F.3d 1275, 1278  xe2  x80  x9479 (11th Cir. 2002).  n  n15Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 16 of 45  n  nThe declaration, in order to be considered, also must   xe2  x80  x9cset out facts that  nwould be admissible in evidence.  xe2  x80  x9d Fed. R. CiV. P. 56(c)(4). Through the Federal  nRules of Evidence, the   xe2  x80  x9cpersonal knowledge  xe2  x80  x9d requirement extends to lay opinion  ntestimony. For non-expert Witnesses, testimony in the form of an opinion is  nlimited to opinions   xe2  x80  x9crationally based on the witness  xe2  x80  x99s perception.  xe2  x80  x9d Fed. R. EVid.  n701(a). The advisory notes to Rule 701 state that subsection (a) codified   xe2  x80  x9cthe  nfamiliar requirement of first  xe2  x80  x94hand knowledge of observation.  xe2  x80  x9d Fed. R. EVid. 701,  nadvisory committee notes, 1972 proposed rules. Rule 701 also requires that lay  nopinion testimony be   xe2  x80  x9chelpful to clearly understanding the witness  xe2  x80  x99s testimony or  nto determining a fact in issue.  xe2  x80  x9d Fed. R. EVid. 701(b).  n  nAs cited by Kindred, the Second Circuit has held that opinion testimony  nabout the motivation for an adverse employment action is inadmissible under  nRule 701(b), because the witness  xe2  x80  x99s opinion Will not be helpful, and the jury can  nreach its own conclusions about the employer  xe2  x80  x99s motivations. Hester v. Bic Corp,  n225 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000). Hester was based only on Rule 701(b) because  nthe parties disclaimed a Rule 701(a) argument. See id. at 181. Applying the  nHester holding to its fullest extent may contradict Rule 704, Which states that  n  nopinion testimony is not   xe2  x80  x9c[a]utomatica11y . . . objectionable just because it  n  n16Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 17 of 45  n  nembraces an ultimate issue.  xe2  x80  x9d Fed. R. EVid. 704. Nevertheless, the underlying  nprinciple remains that a witness may not offer a wholly conclusory opinion  nwithout demonstrating that it is based on personal observations. Cf. Carter 12.  nDecisionOne Corp., 122 F.3d 997, 1005 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that it was not  nplain error to admit testimony regarding an employer  xe2  x80  x99s animus where the  nwitnesses offered their opinions at the conclusion of their testimony and the  nopinion was based on their perceptions).  n  nIn light of the governing rules and principles, portions of Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s  ndeclaration are inadmissible. I find paragraphs 1 through 6, t0 the extent  nprobative, to be properly admissible. The opinions contained in these paragraphs  nthat Willocks was an   xe2  x80  x9cexcellent employee  xe2  x80  x9d and that Carter should have been  nwritten up for her verbal altercation with Willocks are based on Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s factual  ndeclarations that he was Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s direct supervisor and that he witnessed the  nverbal altercation, respectively. [Doc. 38-2 M 1-6.] Likewise, paragraphs 8, 11,  n13, and 15, with the exception of Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s conclusion that Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s high  nblood pressure was based on work-related stress, are admissible as based on  n  nobservations plausibly within the witness  xe2  x80  x99s personal knowledge. [See doc. 38-2.]  n  n17Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 18 of 45  n  nThe remaining paragraphs of Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s declaration, however, are not  nadmissible. In paragraphs 7, 9, and 10, Thigpen offers a conclusion, in different  nphrasing, that Hoffmann discriminated against older employees. The additional  nstatement in paragraph 9 that Hoffmann   xe2  x80  x9cgot her orders from the Headquarters in  nFlorida  xe2  x80  x9d is unsupported by any statement that would suggest how such a fact  ncould be within Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s personal knowledge (or, for that matter, what it  nactually means). Paragraph 14 similarly offers an unsupported conclusion that  nKindred, as an institution, discriminated against Willocks because of a race,  naccent, and national origin. The fact that paragraph 14  xe2  x80  x99s opinion is purportedly  n  xe2  x80  x9c[b]ased on [Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s] observations,  xe2  x80  x9d and Thigpen generally stated in paragraph  n2 that he has   xe2  x80  x9cpersonal knowledge of the facts set forth in this Declaration  xe2  x80  x9d is not  nsufficient to support Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s conclusory opinions about the motivations of  nothers. See Pace, 283 F.3d at 1279.  n  nIt should be noted that Thigpen  xe2  x80  x99s declaration is not the only one in this case  nthat contains information beyond the scope of the witness  xe2  x80  x99s personal knowledge.  nFor example, Schimtt  xe2  x80  x99s declaration contains descriptions of events that he was not  npresent for. [See Doc. 36-4 HI 9, 13.] I will not go through each declaration here  n  nto exclude evidence that was not objected to. But, I also will not rely on any  n  n18Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 19 of 45  n  npiece of evidence that is blatantly outside of the personal knowledge of the  nwitness.  nIV. Discussion  n  nA. Summary J udgment Standard  n  nA court should grant summary judgment When there are no genuine issues  nof material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  nFed. R.

Celotex  n  nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). It is a   xe2  x80  x9cfundamental principle that at  nthe summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of  nthe nonmoving party.  xe2  x80  x9d Tolan 12. Cotton, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 1868 (2014).   xe2  x80  x9cOnly  nWhen that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to  ndemonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary  njudgment.  xe2  x80  x9d Clark v. Coats & Clark, 1116., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).  n  nThe nonmovant is then required   xe2  x80  x9cto go beyond the pleadings  xe2  x80  x9d and to  npresent competent evidence in the form of affidavits, answers to interrogatories,  ndepositions, admissions and the like, designating   xe2  x80  x9cspecific facts showing that  n  nthere is a genuine issue for trial.  xe2  x80  x9d Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (quotation omitted);  n  n19Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 20 of 45  n  nsee Fed.

Liberty  nLobby, Inc., 477 US. 242, 252 (1986). In evaluating a summary judgment  nmotion, all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the nonmovant  xe2  x80  x99s favor.

The McDonnell Douglas6 Burden-Shifting Framework  n  nA plaintiff in an employment discrimination case may prove his case either  nthrough direct or circumstantial evidence. See Desert Palace, Inc. 12. Costa, 539  nUS. 90, 99-100 (2003) (stating the general principle in discussing jury  ninstructions in mixed-motive Title VII cases). In McDonnell Douglas, the  nSupreme Court set up a three-step framework for proving employment  ndiscrimination claims using circumstantial evidence. The plaintiff first has to  npresent a prima facie case of discrimination. Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376  nF.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir. 2004). The prima facie case creates a presumption  nthat the plaintiff was subjected to discrimination. Id. The burden of production  nthen shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason  nfor the challenged employment action. Id. If the defendant is able to offer such a  nreason, the presumption of discrimination is rebutted, and the burden of  nproduction shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant  xe2  x80  x99s justification is  n  njust a pretext for discrimination.

There is no direct evidence of age discrimination.  n  nWillocks contends that there is sufficient direct evidence of age  ndiscrimination to defeat summary judgment. [Doc. 38 at 1.] Specifically,  nWillocks cites to   xe2  x80  x9cDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s statement to Plaintiff that it wanted to   xe2  x80  x98get rid of  xe2  x80  x99  nolder employees by   xe2  x80  x98Writing them up.  xe2  x80  x9d  xe2  x80  x99 [Id. at 2.]  n  nKindred disputes that Hoffmann ever made the statement as alleged by  nWillocks. [D0c. 36-1 at 4-5.] It states that Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony regarding that  nconversation is   xe2  x80  x9cso lacking in credibility  xe2  x80  x9d that it should be disregarded. [Id. at 4-  n5 & n.8.] Kindred also argues that Hoffmann stopped working for Kindred long  n  nbefore Willocks was fired. [Id. at 4-5.] Accordingly, Kindred argues that the  n  n22Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 23 of 45  n  ncomment cannot have been related to the decision to fire Willocks, and therefore  nis not direct evidence of discrimination. [Id. at 5.]  n  nWillocks responds that Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement can represent nothing other  nthan age-based discrimination, and thus is direct evidence. [Doc. 38 at 1-2.] She  nargues that the issue of whether the statement was made is a jury question. [Id. at  n2.] She also argues that Hoffmann was a decision maker at the time she made the  nstatement, and therefore her statement reveals the intent of Kindred. [Id. at 2.]  nWillocks contends that the most important fact is that she was subjected to  nharassment and harsh treatment when she refused to participate in and reported  nHoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s scheme to Kindred. [Id.]  n  nKindred, in reply, reiterates its contention that Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement is  nsupported by Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony alone. [Doc. 39 at 8-9.] It also reiterates that  neven if we were to assume   xe2  x80  x9carguendo  xe2  x80  x9d that Hoffmann made the statements, there  nis no factual dispute that Hoffmann left Kindred well before Willocks was fired.  n[Id. at 9.] They further argue that Willocks failed to demonstrate that the  n  n99  n  nstatement by a non-decision maker constitutes a   xe2  x80  x9cstray remar and cannot be  n  ndirect evidence of discrimination. [Id. at 9-10.]  n  n23Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 24 of 45  n  nAs an initial matter, Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s argument that the Court should disregard  nWillocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony about Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement barely warrants serious  nconsideration. It is a basic principle of summary judgment that reasonable factual  ninferences should be made in favor of the nonmovant. See Tolan, 134 S.Ct. at  n1868. Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s only argument that Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony is   xe2  x80  x9cso lacking in  ncredibility  xe2  x80  x9d that it would be unreasonable to believe it is the implication that the  nPlaintiff cannot credibly offer testimony that is in her favor. [See Doc. 36-1 at 4-  n5.] Such an argument is contradicted by binding case law and basic principles of  njustice. See Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.  n2013) (self  xe2  x80  x94serving statements are admissible and can be sufficient to create an  nissue of fact so long as they are based on personal knowledge). Kindred could  ncertainly argue to a jury that the self  xe2  x80  x94serving nature of Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony  nshould give the jury pause before accepting the testimony as true. But, for  npurposes of this summary judgment motion, it is accepted as true (not arguendo)  nthat Hoffmann told Willocks that she wanted to get rid of employees that were  nolder than Hoffmann. [See Doc. 36-2 at 7-8.]  n  nNevertheless, Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statements do not amount to direct evidence that  n  nKindred fired Willocks because of her age. Willocks bases her argument that  n  n24Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 25 of 45  n  nHoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s comments constitute direct evidence is direct on the case Van  nVoorhis v. Hillsborough County Board of County Commissioners, 512 F.3d 1296  n(11th Cir. 2008). In Van Voorhis, there was evidence that a manager in charge of  nhiring for the defendant declined to interview the plaintiff and others because he  nsaid that   xe2  x80  x9che didn  xe2  x80  x99t want to hire an old pilot.  xe2  x80  x9d See 512 F.3d at 1298. The Circuit  nCourt held that constituted sufficient direct evidence of discrimination to defeat  nsummary judgment. Id. at 1300. The standard, as stated in Van Voorhis, of  n  xe2  x80  x9cdirect evidence  xe2  x80  x9d is   xe2  x80  x9cevidence that re  xef  xac  x82ects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude  ncorrelating t0 the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee.  xe2  x80  x9d  nId. (quotation omitted). The Circuit has further stated that, in order to be direct  nevidence of discrimination, an offending statement must   xe2  x80  x9cbe made concurrently  nWith the adverse employment event, such that no inference is necessary to  nconclude that the bias necessarily motivated the decision.  xe2  x80  x9d Williamson 12.  nAdventist Health Sys./Sunbelt, Inc., 372 F. App  xe2  x80  x99x 936, 940 (11th Cir. 2010),  nciting Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets 0f Fla., 1116., 196 F.3d 1354, 1359 (11th  nCir. 1999).  n  nWillocks is likely correct that Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement was sufficiently  n  nblatant to meet the standard. However, the statement is not connected to the  n  n25Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 26 of 45  n  nadverse employment action complained of here. Hoffmann made the statement to  nWillocks in the context of potentially terminating other employees. Willocks was  nnot fired until at least a year after Hoffmann left the company. There is no  nevidence beyond mere conjecture that would impute Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement onto  nothers at Kindred. In short, even allowing for reasonable inferences, it would be  nunreasonable to conclude that Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement, as re  xef  xac  x82ective as it may be  nthat Hoffmann harbored a discriminatory animus when she said it, bears any  ndirect relationship to Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s firing. Willocks simply cannot point to any  ndirect evidence of discrimination.  n  nWillocks also argues that the statement is direct evidence because   xe2  x80  x9cat the  ntime the statement was made, it was by a decision maker.  xe2  x80  x9d [Doc. 38 at 2.] I am  nnot entirely sure what Willocks means by this. The   xe2  x80  x9cdecision maker  xe2  x80  x9d in an  nemployment case is not a status that is reached by an employee once he or she has  nthe ability to make employment decisions. Rather,   xe2  x80  x9cdecision maker  xe2  x80  x9d refers to the  nspecific person or people who made an employment decision. I am unable to find  na single case that would suggest otherwise. Calling Hoffmann a decision maker  n  n  xe2  x80  x9cat the time  xe2  x80  x9d has no legal significance.  n  n26Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 27 of 45  n  n2. Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case of age  ndiscrimination.  n  nTo make out a prima facie case under the ADEA, the plaintiff must show:  n(1) that she was a member of a protected age class; (2) she was subjected to an  nadverse employment action; (3) that a substantially younger person filled the  nposition from which she was discharged; and (4) she was qualified to do the job.  n  nKragor v.

There is suf  xef  xac  x81cient evidence that would support a  n  xef  xac  x81nding that Willocks was quali  xef  xac  x81ed for the position  nthat she held.  n  nKindred argues that Willocks was not qualified for her position under the  nmeaning of the ADEA because she was not meeting Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s legitimate  nexpectations and objective qualifications for the job. [Doc. 36-1 at 7.]  nSpecifically, they argue that Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s falsification of documents, failure to  nprovide documents to her supervisor rather than to the state auditor, and poor  ndisciplinary history as reasons that she was no longer qualified for the job. [Id. at  n7-8.]  n  nWillocks responds that she worked for Kindred for 20 years before being  n  nwritten up for the first time in 2011. [Doc. 38 at 3.] Further, she argues that the  n  nfactual bases for the times she was disciplined are disputed.

Only objectively verifiable and information easily obtainable by the plaintiff  nshould be considered. Id. To allow a defendant to argue that subjective  nevaluations render the plaintiff unqualified would force the plaintiff to litigate  npretext at the prima facie stage. Id.  n  nTo support its argument that Willocks is unqualified for her job based on  nher performance, Kindred cites to Daniels 12. Hale, 350 F. App  xe2  x80  x99x 380, 385 (11th  nCir. 2009). In Daniels, the Court held that the plaintiff was not qualified for the  njob because   xe2  x80  x9cobjective evaluations  xe2  x80  x9d by witnesses established that she was unable  nto communicate and handle telephone calls at the level of effectiveness required  nfor the job. 350 F. App  xe2  x80  x99x at 385. Daniels, however, is unpublished and non-  nbinding. I do not find Daniels to be persuasive. The conclusion that the plaintiff  nin Daniels was bad at her job was a subjective conclusion, even if based on clear  nobservations. The evaluations did not go to the sort of   xe2  x80  x9cobjectively verifiable  xe2  x80  x9d  n  nfact, like possession of a professional certification, that is ordinarily considered at  n  n28Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 29 of 45  n  nthis stage.

The evaluations in Daniels at least went to the plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  ninability to perform basic tasks that were required for the job. Here, Kindred  npoints to no more than what essentially amounts to asserted insubordination to  nshow Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s lack of qualifications. Even if its allegations were undisputedly  ntrue, Kindred has pointed to nothing that shows that Willocks was less than  ncapable of doing the job. In other words, for purposes of the prima facie case,  nWillocks was qualified for her position.  n  nb. Willocks has not produced or pointed to any  nevidence that anybody younger than her was treated  nmore favorably than she was treated.  n  nKindred also argues that Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case  nbecause she has not identified a comparator who replaced her or was treated more  nfavorably than her. [Doc. 36-1 at 8.] Moreover, Kindred argues that Willocks  n  nhas not pointed to anyone else over 40 who was also fired. [Id.]  n  nWillocks  xe2  x80  x99s response brief does not address the comparator issue.  n  n29Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 30 of 45  n  nThere does not appear to be any evidence in the record regarding who  nultimately replaced Willocks after she was fired. Moreover, there does not appear  nto be any evidence suggesting that a younger employee was treated more  nfavorably. The only evidence regarding other employees is Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony  nregarding the three employees that she believed Hoffmann had targeted for firing.  nThe evidence suggests, however, that those employees were older and were not  nfired. Accordingly, Willocks cannot state a prima facie case under the ADEA,  nbecause she has not identified or presented evidence of a single plausible  ncomparator. Moreover, Willocks does not argue that a comparator would not be  nrequired in this case, and I can discern of no reason to reach that conclusion.  n  nWithout direct evidence or a prima facie case of age discrimination,  nKindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s ADEA claim.  n  nD. Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s ADA  nclaim because there is no evidence that she was disabled.  n  nKindred argues that Willocks has failed to show that she is disabled,  nbecause she failed to present any evidence that her high blood pressure or  ndiabetes affected a major life activity.

The local rule does not speak to the consequence  nof responding to a motion but failing to respond to a specific portion or argument  nWithin the motion. Because the rule lacks such a requirement, and because the  nmovant has the ultimate burden of showing entitlement to summary judgment, I  nWill review the merits of Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s motion as to the ADA claim.  n  nThe ADA, as amended by the ADAAA, prohibits discrimination   xe2  x80  x9cagainst a  nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application  nprocedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee  ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of  nemployment.  xe2  x80  x9d 42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 12112(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of  ndiscrimination under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled;  n(2) she was a   xe2  x80  x9cqualified individual  xe2  x80  x9d at the relevant time, meaning that she could  n  nperform the essential functions of the job in question With or Without a reasonable  n  n31Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 32 of 45  n  naccommodation; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action in  nconnection With her disability. See Lucas 12. WW. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249,  n1255  xe2  x80  x9456 (11th Cir. 2001).7  n  nThe ADAAA and its governing regulations define a   xe2  x80  x9cdisability  xe2  x80  x9d as   xe2  x80  x9c(A) a  nphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major  nlife activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being  nregarded as having such an impairment . . . .  xe2  x80  x9d 42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 12102(1); 29 C.F.R.   xc2  xa7  n1630.2(g)(1).

This phrasing suggests that a plaintiff must prove the ultimate  nquestion of the case  xe2  x80  x94Whether unlawful discrimination occurred  xe2  x80  x94as part of her  nprima facie case. See Holly v. Clairson Indus, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56  n(11th Cir. 2007) (stating the third element as   xe2  x80  x9c[plaintiff] was subjected to  nunlawful discrimination because of his disability  xe2  x80  x9d). As Judge Vining of this  nCourt has noted, the Circuit has   xe2  x80  x9cconsistently formulated the third prong in this  nmanner,  xe2  x80  x9d even though the formulation is incorrect. See Brandon v. Lockheed  nMartin Aeronautical Sys., 393 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1345 (N.D. Ga. 2005). Judge  nVining further noted that, in practice, the Circuit has only required   xe2  x80  x9ca plaintiff to  npresent facts from Which an inference of discrimination can be made (as is true in  nall other discrimination cases),  xe2  x80  x9d Which, at the third prong, only meant showing an  nadverse employment action that could be actionable under the ADA occurred.  n  n32Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 33 of 45  n  nThe ADAAA provides a non  xe2  x80  x94exhaustive list of   xe2  x80  x9cmajor life activities.  xe2  x80  x9d 42  nU.S.C.   xc2  xa7 12102(2)(A).

But neither condition seems to be one that substantially  nlimits a major life activity in every person who has the disease. Here, Willocks  nadmitted as true that she was not restricted as to any work activity. [Doc. 36-8 M  n72-73.] Further, there is no evidence in the record that Willocks was substantially  nlimited in any other activity outside of work. Accordingly, I find that there is not  na triable issue of fact as to whether Willocks was disabled. Thus, Kindred is  nentitled to summary judgment on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s ADA claim.  n  nE. Kindred is entitled to summary judgment as to Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s race,  ncolor, national origin, and accent claims.  n  n1. There is no direct evidence of discrimination.  nThe parties  xe2  x80  x99 arguments regarding direct evidence are more or less the same  nin relation to the race discrimination claims as they were to the age discrimination  nclaims. [See Doc. 36-1 at 18-19; Doc. 38 at 7-8.] For the same reasons discussed  n  nabove, therefore, I conclude that there is no direct evidence of race discrimination.  n  n35Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 36 of 45  n  n2. Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case under Title  nVII 0r   xc2  xa7 1981 based on any protected characteristic  nbecause, again, there is no evidence of a comparator who  n  nwas treated more favorably.  nThe elements of a Claim for employment discrimination are the same under  nTitle VII as they are under 42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 1981. Stallworth v. Shuler, 777 F.2d 1431,  n1433 (11th Cir. 1985). The prima facie elements of a racial discrimination claim  nare: (1) the plaintiff belongs to a protected class; (2) plaintiff was qualified for the  njob; (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) the  nemployer treated plaintiff less favorably than similarly situated persons outside of  nplaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s protected class. Crawford 12. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.  n  n2008).  n  nKindred broadly argues that Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case  nof discrimination because she cannot establish a causal connection between her  ntermination and a protected characteristic. [Doc. 36-1 at 18-19.] The entire  n  npurpose of the prima facie requirement under McDonnell Douglas is that it  n  ncreates a presumption of causation because direct evidence is often missing. See  n  nCombs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1537 (11th Cir. 1997), citing Price  nWaterhouse 12. Hopkins, 490 US. 228, 271 (1989) (O  xe2  x80  x99Connor, J., concurring).  n  nCausation itself is not an element of the prima facie case outside of the retaliation  n  n36Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 37 of 45  n  ncontext. The substance of Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s argument is better suited for an argument  nthat Willocks is unable to show pretext.  n  nDespite Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s misplaced argument, Willocks still cannot make out a  nprima facie case. Just as With the ADEA claim, there is no evidence of a  ncomparator of any protected group different from Willocks Who was treated more  nfavorably than Willocks. The only evidence in the record concerning other  npotentially similarly situated Kindred employees involves individuals Who were  nof the same purported race as Willocks. There is no information in the record  nabout the national origin of those employees. Without any evidence of a similarly  nsituated comparator, Willocks cannot make out a prima facie case of race  ndiscrimination based on circumstantial evidence.  n  nF. Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s  nretaliation claims.  n  nA plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under   xc2  xa7 1981 Where  nshe shows that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a  nmaterially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the  n  nprotected activity and the adverse action. Chapter 7 Trustee v. Gate Gourmet,  n  nInc., 683 F.3d 1249, 1257  xe2  x80  x9458 (11th Cir. 2012).  n  n37Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 38 of 45  n  nKindred argues that Willocks also cannot make out a prima facie case of  nretaliation under Title VII and   xc2  xa7 1981 because she cannot show that she engaged  nin statutorily protected expression or that there was a causal connection between  nany expression and an adverse employment action. [Doc. 36-1 at 21.] Kindred  nargues that there is no evidence that Willocks ever complained to any official  nabout any discrimination at the company. [Id. at 22.] Further, while Willocks  nargues that she refused to go along With Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s directive to fire older,  nHispanic employees, there is no evidence that she voiced that refusal. [Id.]  n  nWillocks responds that she opposed Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s stated intention to fire  nolder, Hispanic employees because she refused to go along With it and   xe2  x80  x9cit was  nreported to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s complaint line.  xe2  x80  x9d [Doc. 38 at 9.] She argues that there is  nno requirement that she report the discrimination to   xe2  x80  x9cthe authorities,  xe2  x80  x9d and asserts  nthat she brought Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statements to the attention of other employees and  nher supervisor. [Id. at 10.]  n  n1. Willocks may have presented suf  xef  xac  x81cient evidence to show  nthat she opposed an unlawful employment practice.  n  nTitle VII prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee Who  n  nhas   xe2  x80  x9copposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII].  xe2  x80  x9d  n  n42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 2000e-3(a). Title VII also makes it unlawful to retaliate against an  n  n38Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 39 of 45  n  nemployee Who has made a charge or participated in an investigation. Id. The  nSupreme Court has held that retaliation claims are cognizable under   xc2  xa7 1981 as  nwell. See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 US. 442, 457 (2008).  n  nInterpreting Title VII, the Supreme Court has held that opposition need not  ntake the form of an employee instigating some sort of action or vocal opposition.  nSee Crawford v. Metro. Gov  xe2  x80  x99t ofNashville & Davidson Cty., Tenn, 555 US. 271,  n277 (2009). While possibly dicta, the Court stated that it   xe2  x80  x9cwould call it  n  xe2  x80  x98opposition  xe2  x80  x99 if an employee took a stand against an employer  xe2  x80  x99s discrimination not  nby   xe2  x80  x98instigating  xe2  x80  x99 action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a  nsupervisor  xe2  x80  x99s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons.  xe2  x80  x9d Id.9  n  nI agree With Kindred that there is no evidence in the record that Willocks  nverbally opposed Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s statement. Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s testimony that she warned  nher fellow co-workers to be careful is likely insufficient. Moreover, the  nanonymous tip line complaint, With zero evidence in the record that Willocks  n  nmade that complaint, is also insufficient.  n  n9 Because this analysis involves interpretation of the specific language in  nTitle VII, I am not sure Whether the same standards would apply to the   xc2  xa7 1981  nretaliation claim. I need not reach that issue, however, because there is no reason  nthat the analysis regarding the causation issue would not apply to the   xc2  xa7 1981  nclaim.  n  n39Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 40 of 45  n  nReading the evidence most favorably to Willocks, however, she may have  nopposed Hoffmann simply by not writing up the employees as directed by  nHoffmann. [See Doc. 36-8 M 61-62.] It may be problematic for Willocks,  nhowever, that Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s directive seems to have been more explicitly  ndiscriminatory 0n the basis of age, not race, and Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s retaliation Claim is  nasserted under Title VII. I Will not decide if that nuance is dispositive, however,  nbecause, even assuming that Willocks opposed an unlawful employment practice  nfor Title VII purposes, I readily conclude that Willocks cannot state a prima facie  ncase because she cannot show a causal connection between an adverse  nemployment action and protected activity.  n  n2. There is no evidence in the record that would support a  nconclusion that there was a causal link between any  nopposition on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s part and her   xef  xac  x81ring.  n  nThe causal link element of the prima facie case is construed broadly. Gate  nGourmet, 683 F.3d at 1260. To establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must  n  nshow only that (1) the decision maker was aware of the protected activity, and  n  n(2) that the protected activity and the adverse actions were not   xe2  x80  x9cWholly unrelated.  xe2  x80  x9d  n  nKidd v.

HI 6.] At the time that she was fired, Willocks reported to Bob Tvrdik, the  nDirector of Plant Operations, and Tvrdik reported to Michael Schmitt, the Chief  nExecutive Officer (  xe2  x80  x9cCEO  xe2  x80  x9d). [Id. HI 7.]  n  nA. Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s Conversation and Interactions with Sally Hoffmann  n  nIn June 2011 or May 2012,2 interim CEO Sally Hoffmann told Willocks  nthat she wanted her to write up older, Hispanic employees in order to get them  nfired. [Doc. 36-8 HI 55, 58.] Willocks believed that Hoffmann wanted to get rid  nof those employees because newer employees would be paid less and because  nolder employees would be eligible for Social Security if fired. [Id. M 61-62.]  nRegarding that conversation, Willocks testified   xe2  x80  x9c[Hoffmann] said to me, we need  nto cut staff. We need to only have four employees here daily. She says what we  nneed to do is get rid of the old employees, the ones that can get Social Security.  n  nThe employees older than [Hoffmann]3, that  xe2  x80  x99s what she said.  xe2  x80  x9d [Doc. 36-2 at 7-8.]  n  n2 There was con  xef  xac  x82icting testimony as to when this conversation occurred.  nAs Hoffmann was no longer with Kindred as of April 2012, I presume that the  nJune 2011 date is the correct one. For purposes of this motion, it is sufficient to  npresume that the conversation happened at some point during Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s tenure  nas interim CEO.  n  n3 Willocks initially said   xe2  x80  x9colder than me,  xe2  x80  x9d but later clarified that she was  nreferring to employees older than Hoffmann.  n  n5Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 41 of 45  n  nKindred argues that Willocks cannot show a causal link between her  nopposition and her firing because the two events   xe2  x80  x9cmust be temporally proximate  xe2  x80  x9d  nin order to establish causation. [Doc. 36-1 at 23-24.] Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s statement of the  nlaw is not precisely correct. The law states that the two events must be   xe2  x80  x9cvery  nclose  xe2  x80  x9d in time in order for a plaintiff to rely on temporal proximity alone to  nestablish a causal link. See Brown v. Ala. Dep  xe2  x80  x99t of Transp., 597 F.3d 1160, 1182  n(11th Cir. 2010), citing Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273  n(2001). A plaintiff can still show causation Where there is not close temporal  nproximity, but she needs to point to other evidence suggestive of causation. Id.  n  nWillocks appears to concede that the temporal gap between her possible  nopposition and her firing is too long to be sufficient on its own. [See Doc. 38 at  n10.] Even if not conceded, I readily conclude that the gap is too long. This  nCircuit has drawn the line on the sufficiency of temporal proximity alone at  nsomewhere between seven weeks and three months. See Brown, 597 F.3d at  n1182; Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. C0., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999).  nThe gap here was over a year. Moreover, there was an intervening change in  n  ncorporate leadership.  n  n41Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 42 of 45  n  nWillocks argues that the termination is sufficiently close   xe2  x80  x9cconsidering how  n  n9  n  nclearly the two square.  xe2  x80  x99 I really am not sure what Willocks means by this  nargument. To the extent Willocks is arguing that her firing was re  xef  xac  x82ective of  nHoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s previously stated desire to fire older employees, such an argument  nwould undermine a claim that a retaliatory animus motivated her firing.  n  nWillocks also argues that intervening retaliatory conduct creates a  nsufficient causal link between her opposition to Hoffmann  xe2  x80  x99s plan and her firing.  n[Doc. 38 at 10.] But Willocks argues that each of these events occurred shortly  nafter her opposition. [Id.] While that may permit a finding that some of the  nintermediate conduct was retaliatory, the only alleged adverse employment action  nis Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s firing. All of the alleged intermediary treatment appears to have  nbeen at the hands of Hoffmann, who left the company long before Willocks was  nfired. [See id.; Doc. 38-3 M 13-15.] Accordingly, even if the intermediary  nconduct were clearly retaliatory, that conduct occurred too long before Willocks  nwas fired to create an inference that Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s eventual termination was the  nresult of retaliation. Moreover, as Kindred points out, short of assertions of a  n  nconspiracy, there is no evidence in the record that anyone employed by Kindred  n  nat the time of Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s firing was even aware of Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s possible opposition  n  n42Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 43 of 45  n  nt0 Hoffmann. In sum, Willocks cannot meet the causation prong 0f the prima  nfacie case, and Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s retaliation  nclaims as well.  n  nG. A brief discussion of pretext.  n  nI am recommending a conclusion that Willocks has not made out a prima  nfacie case on any of her claims. It is therefore unnecessary to reach the parties  xe2  x80  x99  narguments about whether the evidence could show that Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s stated reasons  nfor firing Willocks were pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Nevertheless,  ngiven the advisory function of this report, I will brie  xef  xac  x82y address the parties  xe2  x80  x99  narguments on that issue.  n  nKindred asserts that its legitimate non-discriminatory reason for firing  nWillocks was that she falsified documents for use in a state audit and that she  nprovided the documents directly to the state auditor despite being instructed by a  nsupervisor to not do that. [D0c. 36-1 at 9.] This is sufficient to meet Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s  nlight burden at this stage. See Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1087. The inquiry next turns  nto whether Willocks can point to sufficient evidence that could demonstrate that  nKindred  xe2  x80  x99s stated reasons were mere pretext for discrimination. Willocks cannot  n  nmeet that burden.  n  n43Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 44 of 45  n  nWillocks does not really dispute the factual underpinnings of Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s  nproffered reasoning. Specifically, Willocks concedes that she input the old data  nonto a new form and that she gave some paperwork directly to the state auditor.  n[See Doc. 38 at 4-5; Doc. 36-8 HI 41.] Willocks disputes the conclusions that  nKindred reached based on those facts. She argues that the transfer of data from  none form to another does not amount to forgery 0r falsification, and that she was  nunderstandably acting at the direction of the auditor when she gave the auditor the  nrequested documents. [See Doc. 38 at 4-7.]  n  nA plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the employer  xe2  x80  x99s  n  nproffered reasons for an adverse employment action are   xe2  x80  x9cunworthy of credence.  xe2  x80  x9d  n  nSee Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 US. 133, 143 (2000)  n(quotation omitted). Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s dispute with Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s interpretation of her  nactions does not rise to that level. In essence, Willocks argues that she acted  nreasonably, and therefore did not deserve to be fired. [See Doc. 38 at 5 (arguing  nthat her transferring of data was less severe than a true forgery and that she may  nhave had a duty to follow the auditor  xe2  x80  x99s instruction).] Willocks argues that it  nshould be a question for the jury whether her actions warranted her firing. But,  n  nthe Court  xe2  x80  x99s (and the jury  xe2  x80  x99s) role in discrimination cases is to   xe2  x80  x9cprevent unlawful  n  n44Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 45 of 45  n  n[employment] practices, not to act as a super personnel department that second-  nguesses employers  xe2  x80  x99 business judgments.  xe2  x80  x9d See Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1092. The  nCourt in Wilson made clear that the plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s arguments that the defendant erred  nin judgment in finding her to be insubordinate was insufficient to establish a  ndiscriminatory animus. Here, even accepting Willocks  xe2  x80  x99s contention that her  ntransgressions were not as severe as Kindred asserts, she has not and cannot point  nto evidence in the record that Kindred acted out of a discriminatory or a  nretaliatory animus of any kind, or that Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s stated reasons for firing her were  nso far from the truth that it would suggest that Kindred was lying. Accordingly,  neven if Willocks could make out a prima facie case on any of her claims, she  nwould not be able to demonstrate that Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s stated reasons for firing her were  npretext for discrimination or retaliation.  n  nV. Conclusion  n  nIn light of the above, I RECOMMEND that Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s summary judgment  nmotion [Doc. 36] be GRANTED.  nIT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 6th day of June, 2017.  n  nJ O N K.

[Doc. 36-8 ][ 31; Doc. 38-3 ][ 21.] Willocks stated in a  ndeclaration that she took Carter  xe2  x80  x99s response to mean that Carter wanted forms with  nKindred  xe2  x80  x99s logo at the top.

(Doc. 38-1, (M 9-10.) Kindred CEO  nHoffman left the company in April of 2012.  n  nOn November 14, 2013, Kindred terminated Plaintiff, allegedly in  nconnection with her performance durin g an audit. Kindred accused Plaintiff of  ntransferrin g information from forms with a Vencor logo to forms with a Kindred  nlogo (thereby raising questions about the provenance of the documents), and of  nfailing to provide audit documents to Kindred employees before providin g them  nto the auditor.

Plaintiff claims that she was terminated due to her  nopposition to Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s scheme to   xef  xac  x81re older workers.  n  nPlaintiff   xef  xac  x81led this Complaint in 2015.

Therefore, in accordance with 28 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 636(b)(1) and  nRule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court has reviewed the  nMagistrate Judge  xe2  x80  x99s Recommendation for Clear error as to those claims and   xef  xac  x81nds  nnone. The Court therefore AD OPTS those portions of the R&R as the opinion of  nthe Court.  n  nPlaintiff does object to the dismissal of her Age Discrimination in  nEmployment Act (  xe2  x80  x9cADEA  xe2  x80  x9d) claim and her retaliation claim under Title VII and   xc2  xa7  n1981.

The Court   xef  xac  x81nds that the Magistrate Judge  xe2  x80  x99s R&R is largely  ncorrect and therefore OVERRULES Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Objections.  n  nFirst, Plaintiff objects that the R&R erred when it concluded that Sally  nHoffman  xe2  x80  x99s statements to Plaintiff in 2011 asking Plaintiff to help Hoffman   xef  xac  x81re  nolder works are direct evidence that Plaintiff was discriminated against on the  nbasis of age when she was terminated in 2013.

But  xe2  x80  x9c[d]irect evidence is evidence that  nestablishes the existence of discriminatory intent behind the employment  n  n3  n  ndecision without any inference or presumption.  xe2  x80  x99 Tiggs-Vaughn v.

Because   xe2  x80  x94 as Plaintiff  n  nconcedes   xe2  x80  x94 the Court would have to infer the existence of scheme to terminateCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 47 Filed 06/28/17 Page 4 of 5  n  nPlaintiff in 2013 from Hoffman  xe2  x80  x99s statements made in 2011, those statements are  nnot direct evidence of discrimination. The R&R also correctly observes that  ndiscriminatory statements that are distant in time from an adverse employment  ndecision are generally not direct evidence. And Plaintiff does not provide  nevidence connecting Hoffman  xe2  x80  x99s statements with that of other Kindred  nmanagement level employees, like Carter (who was also involved in the events  nsurroundin g Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 termin ation).  n  nPlaintiff also objects that she made out a prima facie case of  ndiscrimination, and that the R&R erred when it concluded Plaintiff had failed to  npoint to a comparator. Plaintiff objects that   xe2  x80  x9cothers were treated more favorably  nthan Plaintiff   xe2  x80  x94 they were not terminated   xe2  x80  x94 while Plaintiff was terminated.  xe2  x80  x9d  n(Objs. at 2.) But Plaintiff does not identify a single person by name, and does not  nshow how they are in fact appropriate comparators by addressing whether or not  nthey were similarly situated.  n  nPlaintiff next objects that she did create a genuine issue of fact as to  nwhether her opposition to Hoffman  xe2  x80  x99s and Kindred  xe2  x80  x99s alleged scheme to terminate  nolder employees was causally connected to her own termination. But the record  nshows that Hoffman  xe2  x80  x99s statements and the alleged campaign of harassment  nagainst Plaintiff all occurred long before Plaintiff was   xef  xac  x81red. And as the R&R  nobserves, Hoffman stepped down as CEO and new management took her place.  n  nThe gap between Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s opposition and her eventual termination is too lon g toCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404446  xe2  x80  x94AT Document 47 Filed 06/28/17 Page 5 of 5  n  nsustain her claim. Finally, the Court agrees that Plaintiff cannot show pretext for  nthe reasons identified in the R&R.  n  nThe Court acknowledges that Plaintiff was a 22-year veteran at Kindred.  nIt  xe2  x80  x99s more than possible that Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s termination was unfair, given her many  nyears of service.

shifts per  nweek, stage rotation scheduling, work attendance, and interactions With customers  n  nfor Plaintiff and other entertainers at Swinging Richards.  n  n44.  nAt all times during the Relevant Time Period, Defendants set the price  n  nentertainers were allowed to charge for dances.  n  nllCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 1 Filed 12/23/15 Page 12 of 22  n  n45.  n  nAt all times during the Relevant Time Period, Defendants financed all  nadvertising and marketing efforts undertaken on behalf of Swinging Richards; made  ncapital investments in the facilities, maintenance, sound system, lights, food,  nbeverage and inventory; and made all hiring decisions regarding wait staff, security,  nentertainer, managerial and all other employees at Swinging Richards.  n  n46.  n  nAt all times during the Relevant Time Period, Defendants established a variety  nof written guidelines and policies Which governed the conduct of Plaintiff and other  nentertainers at Swinging Richards.  n  n47.  n  nIf Plaintiff or other Swinging Richards entertainers were late for work or failed  nto appear for a scheduled shift, Defendants imposed a fine on them or terminated  nthem.  n  n48.  nAt

Hiring dancers is perhaps the only facet of the club with which  nhe is not directly involved.

When   xe2  x80  x9dVIP room customers pay a dancer with cash  n. . . the VIP doorman keeps the cash in an envelope designated for that specific  ndancer until the end of the night, at which time the dancer collects it.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 45-1  nat 11.

To  ncalculate the cash amounts, the accountant extrapolated   xe2  x80  x9d the amount of cash the  ndancer should have received,  xe2  x80  x9d an unrecorded figure at the time, based on the  namount of time spent in the VIP room, something the club did track. Doc. 45-1  nat 12.  n  nAt some point, the club began using receipts to track the amount of cash  nthe dancers received. Doc. 45-1 at 13. That amount was never inputted into the  ncompany  xe2  x80  x99s spreadsheets, and the physical receipts landed in a box,   xe2  x80  x9dwithout any  n  norganization.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 45-5 at 24; doc 45-1 at 13.

Plaintiffs contend that the receipts and  n  nII  n  nextrapolation calculation are   xe2  x80  x9daccounting trick[s] that do not qualify as  nrecording the payments in 1400   \\'s gross receipts. Doc. 45-5 at 25. Even if they  namounted to recording, Defendants, say Plaintiffs, never distributed the cash.  nThat latter point carries the cash day for Plaintiffs.  n  nAs noted, payments, even if included in a company  xe2  x80  x99s gross receipts, must  n  nbe distributed from the company to the employee in order to qualify as minimum  n  nwage offsetting service charges. Henderson 110 F. Supp. 3d at 1322. Cash  n  n   n  npayments, however, flowed from customers to an envelope, then to dancers at  nthe end of the night. Doc 45-1 at 11. Defendants never distributed. VIP room  ncash payments, then, regardless of their recording in gross receipts, are not  nservice charges that can offset minimum wage obligations.  n  nCredit card payments meet the same fate. Defendants, to the extent they  n  nrespond to this issue at all, present the same arguments as they did in Henderson  n  n18Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 19 of 23  n  nand in another FLSA case against a Jones-affiliated club.

Those cases refused to treat credit card payments differently than cash tips  nreceived directly from customers because the method of payment did not alter  n  ntheir essential character. Li; Henderson 110 F. Supp. 3d at 1323. Other cases  n  n   n  nevaluating similar VIP dance room payments come to the same conclusion. See,  n  ngg, Hart V. Rick   \\'s Cabaret Int   \\'l Inc. 967 F.

That [the club] maintained incomplete records of the total performance  nfees paid, with partial records being generated only by the happenstance that  nsome customers chose to pay by credit card, does not make the recorded  npayments qualitatively different from the non-recorded ones.  xe2  x80  x9d).  n  nNothing differentiates this case or Swinging Richard  xe2  x80  x99s credit card  npayments. But for the   xe2  x80  x9daccident  xe2  x80  x9d that they temporarily passed to 1400 before  ntheir conversion to a check and payment to Plaintiffs, those payments mirror  n  ncash payments that indubitably qualify as tips, not service charges. Although  n  n19  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 20 of 23  n  ncredit card payments, by Virtue of their electronic transmission were recorded in  nDefendants  xe2  x80  x99 gross receipts and technically distributed by Defendants, they  nremained payments from a customer to the dancer for services rendered, and  npayments from which the club apparently deducted nothing (the record is silent  nabout whether 1400 retained a processing fee, instead stating only that   xe2  x80  x9d [w]hen  nVIP room customers pay a dancer by credit card, the Company issues the dancer  n  na check 24 hours later,  xe2  x80  x9d see doc. 45-1 at 11). They thus remained tips, not service  n  n   n  ncharges, and cannot be used to offset Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 FLSA obligation to pay a  n  nminimum wage.  n  nF.

The court  nwill deem the movant  xe2  x80  x99s citations supportive of its facts unless the  n  nrespondent specifically informs the court to the contrary in the response.  n  nnmmwm.  n  nA. Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 Statement of Undisputed Fact  n  nOf the eighty-seven paragraphs in Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 statement, Defendants contest  nonly five: paragraphs 2, and 84-87. Doc. 52-16. Because they otherwise comply  nwith L.R. 56.1, the Court deems admitted the uncontested paragraphs (1, and 3-  n83).  n  nParagraph two relates to Swinging Richard  xe2  x80  x99s sale of alcoholic beverages.  nDoc. 45-1 at 2 (the club  xe2  x80  x99s website advertises its sales of a variety of liquors, many  nof which swam in interstate commerce currents before their purchase by the  nclub). Defendants say the paragraph lacks a foundation and contains hearsay.  nDoc. 52-16 at 2. But claiming   xe2  x80  x9dhearsay  xe2  x80  x9d without any elaboration is not enough  nto sustain that objection, particularly when evidence (testimony and a website)  nsupports the fact to which Defendants object. The same goes for foundation  nobjections, particularly when made in a L.R. 56.1 response. Defendants do not  n  notherwise contest the alcohol allegation (such as by pointing out that the  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 21 of 23  n  nwages   xe2  x80  x94 they received only tipped compensation from customers   xe2  x80  x94 much less a  nminimum wage of $7.25 per hour.

Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 Counterclaims  n  nIn their sole counterclaim, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs breached their  nemployment contracts by filing this lawsuit. Doc. 11 at 10.

Defendants submit no evidence of a contract or  nunjust enrichment beyond the allegations in their counterclaim.  n  nPlaintiffs argue that FLSA minimum wage rights   xe2  x80  x9dcannot be abridged by  n  ncontract or otherwise waived.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 45-5 at 28.   xe2  x80  x9dBecause [they] were  n  n21  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 22 of 23  n  nemployees,  xe2  x80  x9d Plaintiffs say, any breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law.  nLi. at 29.   xe2  x80  x9d [T]o the extent that Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 counterclaim constitutes a claim for  nunjust enrichment,  xe2  x80  x9d that too fails because   xe2  x80  x9dPlaintiffs received all their monies  xe2  x80  x9d  nfrom customers.

The parties must submit a proposed pretrial order within thirty days of  n  nthe date this Order is served.  n  nso ORDERED, this 15th day of June 2017.  n  ns 1 Steve C. lones  nHONORABLE STEVE C. JONES  n  nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  n  n23  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 4 of 23  n  nevidence cited does not support the fact), so it, too, is admitted.  n  nEven if the objections had merit, it doesn  xe2  x80  x99t matter. The alcohol allegation  nrelates only to 1400   \\'s possible enterprise liability under the FLSA. As discussed  nbelow, collateral estoppel bars relitigation of that issue, which is in any case  nsupported by other, uncontested, facts. E doc. 45-1 at 2 1] 3 (  xe2  x80  x9d1400 derives  nrevenues from fees paid by customers on two ATMs in Swinging Richards, one  nof which uses the phone lines and the other of which uses an Internet  nconnection.  xe2  x80  x9d).  n  nParagraph 84 states that   xe2  x80  x9dPlaintiffs receive no wages for their dancing  nwork at Swinging Richards.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 45-1 at 14. Defendants disagree, stating that  n  xe2  x80  x9dhouse-set, minimum charges for table dances and VIP Room Visits count as  n  xe2  x80  x9dwages[,]  xe2  x80  x9d [] not   xe2  x80  x9dtips[,]  xe2  x80  x9d [] per the IRS and Department of Labor.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 52-16 at  n3. That, however, is a legal conclusion that fails to qualify as a valid objection  nunder L.R. 561(3) (2) (a) (2) Still, Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99   xe2  x80  x9dfact  xe2  x80  x9d itself contains hints of  nconclusion. Whether Defendants paid   xe2  x80  x9dwages  xe2  x80  x9d is in some sense the ultimate  nissue in this litigation. To the extent paragraph 84 refers to that issue, then, it is  nnot deemed admitted. Insofar as it Plaintiffs meant that they do not receive any  n  nmoney directly from Defendants (i.e., that they received money only from  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 5 of 23  n  ncustomers), that fact is admitted.  n  nParagraphs 85-87 relate to Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 knowledge of a previous FLSA  nlawsuit against the same defendants as in this case, and of their ability to opt  xe2  x80  x94in  nto its settlement. Doc. 45-1 at 14-15. Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 object that   xe2  x80  x9d[w]hat plaintiffs  nknew cannot be determined without a thorough testing and examination of their  ncredibility.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 52-16 at 3. But that is not a L.R. 56.1-compliant objection  xe2  x80  x94it  ndoes not directly refute Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 proferred fact, it does not object to  nadmissibility, and it does not highlight a lack of evidentiary support. The Court  ntherefore deems paragraphs 85-87 admitted.  n  nPlaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 Statement of Undisputed Fact, all of which the Court deems  nadmitted, forms the basis for what follows.  n  nII. BACKGROUND  n  n  xe2  x80  x9dSwinging Richards is a nightclub featuring nude male dancers in Atlanta,  nGeorgia, which is owned and operated by Defendant 1400 Northside Drive, Inc.  xe2  x80  x9d  nDoc. 45-1 at 1 (Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 Statement of Material Fact). 1400 is itself owned by  ndefendant CB. Jones, who also owns the property on which the club sits. Li. at  n  n9. Plaintiffs Zachary Chastain and Travis Delduca are former male strippers who  n  nworked at the club from 2013 until late-2016 (October for Delduca, December for  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 6 of 23  n  nChastain). Li. at 3. Wilson, who began dancing at the club in 2013, remains  nemployed by 1400. Li. at 3.  n  n1400 classifies its dancers as independent contractors and compensates  nthem exclusively through customer tips. Doc. 45-1 at 14. It does not, however,  n  xe2  x80  x9dkeep records of payments made to dancers by customers for performances on  nstage . . . [or] for table  xe2  x80  x94side dances.  xe2  x80  x9d Li. at 10. Cash from VIP room customers  nstays in an envelope with the VIP doorman   xe2  x80  x9duntil the end of the night, at which  ntime the dancer collects it.  xe2  x80  x9d Li. at 11. 1400 issues checks to dancers twenty-four  nhours after a VIP roomcustomer pays with a credit card.  n  nIn March 2014, 1400   xe2  x80  x9dbegan having dancers fill out timesheets.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 45-1  nat 11.   xe2  x80  x9d [T]hose timesheets contain[ed] dancers   \\' time in and out, total VIP rooms,  nand total tips, but not the actual amount earned from VIP dances.  xe2  x80  x9d 1400  xe2  x80  x99s  naccountant then filed those timesheets,   xe2  x80  x9dand did nothing else with them.  xe2  x80  x9d Li.  n  n  xe2  x80  x9dAt some point . . . Defendants began having the VIP manager track the  namounts of money dancers received in cash for VIP dances  xe2  x80  x9d by giving the dancer  na receipt. Doc. 45-1 at 13. That manager never entered the total cash received  n  namount into   xe2  x80  x9dhis computer spreadsheet.  xe2  x80  x9d Li. The receipts were   xe2  x80  x9dperiodically  xe2  x80  x9d  n  nsent to 1400   \\'s accountant, but he   xe2  x80  x9dsimply put them in a box  xe2  x80  x9d   xe2  x80  x94 he did not use the  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 7 of 23  n  nreceipts to calculate revenues for tax return purposes. Li. Instead, the  naccountant   xe2  x80  x9dextrapolated the dancers  xe2  x80  x99 minimum VIP fees based on the length of  nthe room rentals recorded on the VIP manager  xe2  x80  x99s spreadsheet.  xe2  x80  x9d Li.   xe2  x80  x9dOn a  nmonth  xe2  x80  x94to-month basis, the club did nothing to account for the dancers  xe2  x80  x99 VIP fees.  xe2  x80  x9d  nLi. Dancers now must write   xe2  x80  x9dtheir total cash received on the back of their  ntimecards, [but] Swinging Richards does nothing with that information for  naccounting purposes.  xe2  x80  x9d Li. at 14.  nIII. ANALYSIS  n  nPlaintiffs seek summary judgment on seven discreet issues: (1) whether  nPlaintiffs were employees or independent contractors; (2) whether 1400   xe2  x80  x9dis an  n  xe2  x80  x99enterprise engaged in commerce  xe2  x80  x99 as that term is used in the FLSA and is subject  nto the FLSA  xe2  x80  x99s minimum wage provisions;  xe2  x80  x9d (3) whether   xe2  x80  x9dJones is a joint  nemployer;  xe2  x80  x9d (4) whether   xe2  x80  x9dPlaintiffs are not exempt   xe2  x80  x99creative professionals;  xe2  x80  x99  xe2  x80  x9d (5)  nwhether VIP room and table dance fees qualified as   xe2  x80  x9dservice charges  xe2  x80  x9d that offset  nDefendants minimum wage obligations; (6) whether Plaintiffs can obtain  n$7.25/ hr in back wages   xe2  x80  x9dfor each hour worked in the statutory limitations period,  nin addition to reimbursement of all fees and fines paid;  xe2  x80  x9d and (7) whether  n  nDefendants  xe2  x80  x99 breach of contract and unjust enrichment counterclaims fail. Doc.A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 8 of 23  n  n45-5 at 30-31. They also contend that two orders in another FLSA case brought  nby Swinging Richards dancers should bar relitigation of issue one, and issues  nthree through seven. Li. at 5. Before delving into all that, however, a Local Rule  nrequires the Court to address Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 summary judgment response.  n  nLocal Rule 7.1 (B) makes clear that   xe2  x80  x9d [f]ailure to file a response shall indicate  nthat there is no opposition to the motion.  xe2  x80  x9d And defendants  xe2  x80  x99 response   xe2  x80  x9dbrief  xe2  x80  x9d  n(doc. 52) as discussed in a previous Order (doc. 57), lacks much substance. For  nexample, in addressing issue one (enterprise liability), it states in its unedited  nentirety:   xe2  x80  x9d[s]ee, discussion in the comments and annotations of the 11th Circuit  nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Exhibits 1 and 2. Clearly, these  ndeterminations involve questions of law for a jury to decide.  xe2  x80  x9d Doc. 52.  n  nAs made clear in its previous Order, the Court will not sift through cited  nbut unargued legal authorities, briefs from other cases, and other documents  nincorporated by reference. The Court will not manufacture arguments for  nDefendants. In essence, responses like Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 enterprise liability argument  nare no response at all.  n  nIll  n  nDefendants creative professionals  xe2  x80  x9d defense, their response to Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99  n  nproposed calculation of back pay, and their argument in favor of theirCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 9 of 23  n  ncounterclaims contain similar flaws. Doc. 52 at 4-6. For each one, Defendants  nbarely respond at all, and when they do, they simply refer the Court to case law  nand briefing from another FLSA action involving 1400 and many of the same  nissues. Li.  n  nStill, the Court discerns opposition from Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 limited   xe2  x80  x9dresponses.  xe2  x80  x9d  nIt therefore will not deem anything unopposed pursuant to L.R. 7.1(B), with the  nexception of Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 employee/ independent contractor argument (Defendants  nfail to address that issue at all). But Defendants did themselves no favors. The  nsuccess or failure of Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 summary judgment motion on the issues to which  nDefendants barely respond thus rises and falls with Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 arguments and  n  nfacts alone. But first, Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 collateral estoppel argument.  n  nA. Non  xe2  x80  x94Mutual Offensive Collateral Estoppel  n  n  xe2  x80  x9dOffensive, nonmutual collateral estoppel is a doctrine under which a  nplaintiff asserts that a defendant is barred from litigating an issue based on a  ndecision rendered in a case in which the plaintiff was not involved.  xe2  x80  x9d Demaree  nV. Fulton Cty. Sch. Dist., 515 F. App  xe2  x80  x99x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Parklane  nHosiery Co. V. Shore, 439 US. 322, 327  xe2  x80  x9428 (1979)).   xe2  x80  x9dIn order for nonmutual  n  ncollateral estoppel to apply, the issue currently before the Court (1) must be  n  nA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 10 of 23  n  nidentical to the one alleged in the prior litigation; (2) the issue must have been  nactually litigated; and (3) the determination in the prior proceeding must have  n  nbeen a crucial and necessary part of the judgment in the earlier action.  xe2  x80  x9d Berry V.  n  nGreat Am. Dream Inc. No. 1:13-CV-3297-TWT, 2014 WL 5822691, at *7 (ND. Ga.  n  n   n  nNov. 10, 2014) (citing A.|. Taft Coal Co. V. Connors, 829 F.2d 1577, 1580 (11th  nCir.1987)).  n  nAs mentioned, this is not 1400   \\'s first litigation rodeo. In Henderson V. 1400  nNorthside Drive   xe2  x80  x94 a case brought by male strippers alleging the same minimum  nwage claims Plaintiffs here assert  xe2  x80  x94 this Court held that 1400 suffered enterprise  nliability under the FLSA because (1) it had gross annual sales   xe2  x80  x9din excess of  n$500,000,  xe2  x80  x9d and (2) it engaged in commerce by selling customers alcohol that it  nobtained   xe2  x80  x9dfrom outside of Georgia.  xe2  x80  x9d 2016 WL 3125012, at *2 (ND. Ga. June 3,  n2016). It also held that Jones incurred individual liability because he wielded  nenough control over 1400 to qualify as an employer. Li. at *3. In a separate  nOrder, the Court rejected 1400   \\'s creative professional defense because the  n  nstrippers  xe2  x80  x99 dancing did not reflect a sufficiently high degree of creativity.  n  nHenderson V. 1400 Northside Drive Inc. 110 F.

COLLECTIVE ACTION ALLEGATIONS  n  n8. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all other similarly  nsituated employees of Defendants.

Defendants knew that Plaintiff and similarly situated technicians  nperformed work beyond forty hours per week that required overtime pay, but failed  nto compensate Plaintiff and other employees for all of this work.  n  n14.

Achieve  xe2  x80  x99s President responded that there was no work  navailable for Ellis.  n  n19.  n  nEven as Achieve told Ellis no work was available, the company was  nstruggling to find enough workers to complete all the work that needed to be done,  neven offering bonuses and overtime payments to Home Health Aides to encourage  n  nthem to perform more work.Case 1:15-cv-04464-MHC Document 1 Filed 12/28/15 Page 6 of 11  n  n20.  n  nAlthough Ellis was available to work and Achieve needed workers, Achieve  n  nnever placed Ellis on any assignments.

SUTTON,  nindividually and on behalf of all  n  nothers similarly situated : Civil Action File No.  nPlaintiff,  nvs.  n  nJury Trial Demanded  nHENNECOLD STORAGE,  nINC.,  nDefendant.  n  nCOMPLAINT  n  nPlaintiff Russell R. Sutton, brings this Complaint against Hennecold Storage,  n  nInc., and shows the Court as follows:  n  nINTRODUCTION  n  n1.  n  nThis is a case brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act.Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404486  xe2  x80  x94RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 2 of 25  n  n2.  n  nIn addition to his federal causes of action, Plaintiff asserts pendent state law  nclaims Which arise out of the same set of operating facts as his federal claims.  nThese are (l) breach of contract, (2) quantum meruit and (3) promissory estoppel.  n  n3.  n  nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold systematically truncated its  ncompensation of Sutton--as well as its compensation of all similarly situated  nemployees that Sutton seeks to represent  xe2  x80  x94by failing to correctly convert the hours  nand minutes its employees worked into proper digital values for pay purposes.  nHennecold  xe2  x80  x99s improper calculation resulted in every hourly employee being paid less  nthan the amount earned for every week worked by such employees.  n  n4.  n  nIn addition to this claim of pay truncation, Sutton brings his own claims for l)  nimproper deduction of thirty minutes each day for a break When the company knew  nor should have known that he often did not take such a break; and 2) his  n  nmisclassi  xef  xac  x81cation as exempt during certain periods of his employment.Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 11 of 25  n  n42.  nDuring the maj ority of Sutton  xe2  x80  x99s work time, he operated equipment and worked  nalongside Hennecold  xe2  x80  x99s laborers to move merchandise Within Hennecold  xe2  x80  x99s  nwarehouse.  n  n43.  n  nSutton did not interview potential new employees for Hennecold.  n  n44.  n  nSutton did not make recommendations regarding candidates for employment  nWith Hennecold that Hennecold afforded any particular weight.  n45.  nSutton did not have the authority to hire employees for Hennecold.  n46.  nSutton did not train employees for Hennecold.  n47.  nSutton did not set or adjust the pay rates of employees for Hennecold.  n  n48.  n  nSutton did not set or adjust the work hours of employees for Hennecold.  n  n11Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404486  xe2  x80  x94RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 12 of 25  n  n49.  nSutton did not maintain the production or sales records for use in supervision or  ncontrol of employees for Hennecold.  n50.  nSutton did not handle complaints and grievances of employees for Hennecold.  n5 1.  nSutton did not determine discipline employees for Hennecold.  n52.  nSutton recorded the quantities of materials utilized into Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s tracking  nsystem for upper management to track.  n5 3.  nSutton did not provide for the safety and security of the employees of  nHennecold.  n54.  nSutton did not plan or control any budget for Hennecold.  n  n55.  n  nSutton did not monitor or implement legal compliance measures for Hennecold.  n  n12Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 13 of 25  n  n56.  n  nAt all times material hereto, Sutton did not have the authority to   xef  xac  x81re employees  nfor Hennecold.  n  n57.  n  nAt all times material hereto, Sutton did not make recommendations regarding  nhiring,   xef  xac  x81ring, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other  nemployees to Which Hennecold attached particular weight.  n  n58.  n  nDespite not having the primary duty of exempt work, Sutton was misolassi  xef  xac  x81ed  n  nas exempt during portions of his employment With Hennecold.  n  nImproper Deduction for Breaks  n  n5 9.  nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold auto-deduoted thirty minutes from each  nof Sutton  xe2  x80  x99s work days.  n60.  nHennecold knew, or should have known in the exercise of reasonable  nmanagement practices, that Sutton did not take lunch or other break approximately  n  n  xef  xac  x81fty percent of the time.  n  n13Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 14 of 25  n  n61.  nAs a result of this auto-deduction, Sutton  xe2  x80  x99s pay was reduced below that agreed  n  nupon and, in certain weeks, resulted in a reduction of the overtime pay required.  n  nImproper Pay Computation Allegations  n62.  n  nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold recorded the work time of Sutton and  n  nall similarly situated warehouse workers.  n63.  nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold  xe2  x80  x99s Employee Time Records expressed  neach employee  xe2  x80  x99s work time in hours and minutes divided by a colon.  n64.  n  nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold regularly and systematically truncated  nthe compensation it paid Sutton and all similarly situated warehouse workers by  nfailing to properly convert such horological values into correct digital values (i.e.,  ntime expressed by hours and hundredths of an hour and divided by a decimal point)  nfor pay purposes.  n  n65.  nAt all times material hereto, Hennecold regularly and systematically improperly  n  nconverted such horological values into incorrect digital values by substituting a  n  n14Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 15 of 25  n  ndecimal point for the colon and by no further adjustment to account for the  ndifference between minutes (i.e., by sixtieths of an hour) and the hundredths of an  n  nhour used in a digital value.  n  n66.  n  nFor example, during the week that ended August 28, 2013, Sutton (Without  ntaking into account the auto-deduction for a break) worked for Hennecold a total of  n  xef  xac  x81fty-six hours and thirty-nine minutes (i.e., a horological value that is expressed as  n56:39).  n  n67.  nThe horological value expressed as 56:39 is equivalent to the digital value of  n  n56.65 hours.  n  n68.  n  nHennecold converted the horological value of Sutton  xe2  x80  x99s work time for the week  nending on August 28, 2013 by merely replacing the colon of the horological value  nWith a decimal, resulting in the incorrect digital value of 56.39 hours/minutes in  nlieu of the correct value of 5 6.65 hours.  n  n69.  nAn employee Who is not exempt from the FLSA  xe2  x80  x99s overtime requirements and  n  nWho works 56 hours and 39 minutes for his employer in a workweek should be  n  n15Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 16 of 25  n  ncompensated by such employer for 40.0 hours at his regular rate and for an  n  nadditional 16.65 hours at an overtime rate equivalent to one and one half of his  n  nregular rate.  n  n70.  nHennecold paid Sutton for the work he performed in the week ending August  n28, 2013 at his regular rate for 40.0 hours and at his overtime rate for 16.39 hours.  n7 1 .  nHennecold thus truncated Sutton  xe2  x80  x99s pay for the work he performed in the week  nending August 28, 2013 by .26 hours at his overtime rate.  n72.  nBy way of further example, during the week that ended September 4, 2013,  nSutton worked for Hennecold a total of   xef  xac  x81fty-  xef  xac  x81ve hours and   xef  xac  x81fty-six minutes (i.e., a  n  nhorological value expressed as 55:56).  n  n73.  nThe horological value expressed as 55:56 is equivalent to the digital value of  n  n55.93 hours.  n  n16Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 17 of 25  n  n74.  nAn employee Who is not exempt from the FLSA  xe2  x80  x99s overtime requirements and  n  nWho works 55:56 for his employer in a workweek should be paid for 40.0 hours at  n  nhis regular rate and for 15.93 hours at his overtime rate.  n75.  n  nHennecold paid Sutton for the work he performed in the week ending  nSeptember 4, 2013 at his regular rate for 40.0 hours and at his overtime rate for  n15 .56 hours.  n  n76.  n  nIn doing so, Hennecold truncated Sutton  xe2  x80  x99s compensation for the work he  nperformed in the week ending September 4, by the value of .37 hours at his  novertime rate.  n  n77.  n  nDuring each week Within the three years immediately preceding this action,  n  nHennecold repeated this pattern of improper compensation calculation for Sutton  n  nand all similarly situated employees.  n  n17Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 18 of 25  n  nCOUNT I - FAILURE TO PAY OVERTIME  n  n78.  n  nThe allegations in all previous paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if  nfully set out in this paragraph.  n  n79.  n  nAt all times material hereto, Sutton was an employee covered by the FLSA and  nentitled to the overtime protections set forth in FLSA  xc2  xa7 7(a), 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 207(a).  n  n80.  n  nDuring his employment with Defendant, Sutton regularly worked in excess of  n40 hours each week.  n  n8 1 .  n  nDefendant failed to pay Sutton at one-and-one-half times his regular rate for all  ntime worked in excess of 40 hours in any week during the entire period of his  nemployment.  n  n82.  n  nDefendant willfully failed to Sutton at one and one half times his regular rate  n  nfor work in excess of 40 hours in any week during the entire period of his  n  nemployment.  n  n18Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 19 of 25  n  n83.  nSutton is entitled to payment of overtime in an amount to be determined at trial,  nin accordance with FLSA   xc2  xa7 16(b), 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 216(b).  n84.  nAs a result of the underpayment of overtime compensation as alleged above,  nSutton is entitled to liquidated damages in accordance With FLSA   xc2  xa7 16(b), 29  n  nU.S.C.   xc2  xa7 216(b).  n  n85.  n  nAs a result of the underpayment of overtime compensation as alleged above,  nSutton is entitled to his litigation costs, including his reasonable attorney  xe2  x80  x99s fees in  naccordance With FLSA   xc2  xa7 16(b); 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 216(b).  n  nCOUNT II - COLLECTIVE ACTION ALLEGATIONS AS TO THE TRUNCATION  nOF ACTUAL TIME WORKED  n86.  n  nThe allegations in all previous paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if  n  nfully set out in this paragraph.  n  n87.  nAt all times during the three years prior to the   xef  xac  x81ling of this Complaint,  nHennecold violated 29 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 207 With respect to all hourly workers it employed  n  nby failing to properly convert the horological value of the hours they worked each  n  n19Case 1:15-cv-04486-RWS Document 1 Filed 12/29/15 Page 20 of 25  n  nweek into correct digital values for pay computation purposes in the same manner  n  nas alleged above With respect to Sutton.  n88.  n  nAll hourly warehouse workers Whom Hennecold

x80  x99 fees and costs of  nlitigation, and other such equitable and legal relief that this Court   xef  xac  x81nds proper.  n  n90.  n  nThe proposed collective of individuals similarly situated to Sutton should be  nde  xef  xac  x81ned as   xe2  x80  x9call individuals Who have worked as hourly employees for Hennecold  nStorage in the three years prior to the   xef  xac  x81ling of this suit

In October 2013, Mr. Hassan learned that his wife  xe2  x80  x99s pregnancy had  ncomplications and that she would require cardiologic care.  n  n16. Consequently, on October 30, 2013, Mr. Hassan notified his  nsupervisor, Wes Newsome, General Manager of Camping World in Woodstock,  nGeorgia, that he would need to take leave to provide for her care.  n  n17. On November 5, 2013, Mr. Hassan submitted Camping World  xe2  x80  x99s  n  xe2  x80  x9cPersonnel Status Change Form  xe2  x80  x9d to Tamiko Taylor, the local human resources  nrepresentative, J oel Cline, Regional Vice President, and Newsome to request his  naccrued paid time off (PTO) and   xef  xac  x82oating holidays (FH).  n  n18.

Mr. Hassan ultimately was approved for continuous FMLA leave  nbeginning November 11, 2013 through February 27, 2014.  n  n24. Not satisfied With denying Mr. Hassan  xe2  x80  x99s leave, Newsome harassed Mr.  nHassan by email regarding When he would return to work.  n  n25. After Mr. Hassan requested FMLA leave, Mr. Newsome issued a  n  xe2  x80  x9cDisciplinary Action  xe2  x80  x9d to Mr. Hassan on November 9, 2013 on a form not otherwise  nused by Camping World.  n  n26. Newsome listed the unsigned PTO request as a reason for the  ndisciplinary action, even though Mr. Hassan submitted the form to Newsome by  nemail following his Wife  xe2  x80  x99s emergency.  n  n27. Newsome also listed   xe2  x80  x9c[n]0t communicating With direct supervisor  n  nthroughout time away  xe2  x80  x9d as a reason for the discipline, despite that Mr. HassanCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404498  xe2  x80  x94WSD Document 1 Filed 12/30/15 Page 6 of 13  n  nemailed Newsome and other team members during his leave to ensure the  ndepartment ran smoothly in his absence.  n  n28.

Shortly thereafter, she notified Mr. Hassan that his FMLA paperwork  nhad been approved and that the investigation into his retaliation claims was  nongoing, but Mr. Hassan never received any further response regarding his  n  ncomplaints.  n  n36.

BRENNAN, Postmaster  nGeneral, United States Postal Service,  n  nDefendant.  n  nFINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  nAND ORDER  n  nPlaintiff Monica Moten (  xe2  x80  x9cPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99) is proceeding in this matter pro se.  nOn December 31, 2015, Plaintiff initiated this action by completing and filing a  nhandwritten, pro se employment discrimination complaint form. (Doc. 3, Complaint).  nPlaintiff alleges in her Complaint that her former employer, the United States Postal  nService (  xe2  x80  x9cUSPS  xe2  x80  x9d or   xe2  x80  x9cDefendant  xe2  x80  x9d), unlawfully discriminated and retaliated against her  non the basis of race (black) and seX (female), wrongfully terminated her, and subj ected  nher to haras sment, in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,  n42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 2000e, et seq. (  xe2  x80  x9cTitle VII  xe2  x80  x9d).  n  nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s Motion for Summary Judgment  n  n(Doc. 35) and Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s Motion for an Extension of Time (Doc. 39) to file her responseA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv-04515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 2 of 39  n  nt0 Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Motion for Summary Judgment. Because Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s motion for an  nextension and her summary judgment response were untimely filed, Defendant opposes  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s motion for an extension. (Doc. 41).  n  nFor the reasons stated below, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s motion for an extension (Doc. 39) is  nGRANTED. I RECOMMEND that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary judgment  n(Doc. 35) be GRANTED.  n  nI. PLAINTIFF  xe2  x80  x99S MOTION FOR AN EXTENSION  n  nAfter the extended discovery period in this matter closed, Defendant timely filed  nits motion for summary judgment on J anuary 17, 2017. (Doc. 35). Pursuant to Local  nRule 56.1 and this Court  xe2  x80  x99s Scheduling Order issued on May 24, 2016 (Doc. 16),  nPlaintiff had twenty-one days from the date Defendant served its motion for summary  njudgment on her to file her response. LR 56.1, NDGa. On February 21, 2017, after  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s deadline for filing her response had passed, Plaintiff filed a two-and-a  xe2  x80  x94half  npage response opposing Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s motion for summary judgment (With 36 pages of  nattachments), and a very short motion asking the Court  xe2  x80  x99 3 permission to extend the time  n  nfor filing her response   xe2  x80  x9c[d]ue t0 the complexity of producing evidence and research.  xe2  x80  x9d  n  n(Does. 39, 40).A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 11 of 39  n  nthat Ms. Gomez was making her re-do scans she had performed earlier in the day, which  nmade her late with her pick-up twice in one week, and   xe2  x80  x9cmade it impossible for  n[Plaintiff] to meet [her] dispatch.  xe2  x80  x9d (Doc. 38-1 at 23). Plaintiff stated that she was afraid  nof losing her job, and she asked for Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal  xe2  x80  x99 s assistance in resolving her concerns.  n  nIn response, Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal sent Plaintiff a reply email stating that she had called  nSherry Garrett regarding Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s concerns, and Garrett told O  xe2  x80  x99Neal that she had just  nspoken with Plaintiff and would speak with her again concerning the issues Plaintiff had  nraised. (Doc. 40-2 at 17). Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal told Plaintiff that she hoped her issues would be  nresolved, but if they were not, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s next step was to speak directly with the  nPostmaster. (I_d.). Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal closed by stating that   xe2  x80  x9cHR does not get involved in  nsituations that can be resolved within the office.  xe2  x80  x9d (I_d.).  n  nFollowing Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s email to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal, Plaintiff met the same day with her  nunion steward, Will Stephens, and her direct supervisor, Sherry Garrett, about  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s work hours and overtime. Mr. Stephens informed Ms. Garrett that as a PSE,  nPlaintiff was not permitted to work over 12 hours a day. (Moten Dep. at 85).  n  nMs. Garrett agreed to submit a request for an adjustment with regard to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  n  novertime hours. (Ld. at 84, 88, 109-10, 112-13; Doc. 38-1 at 20).  n  n11A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 12 of 39  n  nStarting on or about March 10, 2014, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s work hours were significantly  nreduced, and Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Saturday work schedule was changed to a split shift where  nPlaintiff worked from 5:00 am. to 10:30 am, then she returned to work from 3:00 p.m.  nto 6:00 p.m. (Doc. 38-1 at 14). After her work hours were reduced, Plaintiff  ncomplained that she was being held accountable for performing her entire dispatch  nworkload in half the time. (Id. at 8).  n  nDuring Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s period of employment at the Woodstock Post Office, Sherry  nGarrett observed numerous deficiencies in Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s job performance. (DSMF HI 12).  nAt an EEO hearing before an administrative judge on May 20, 2015, Ms. Garrett  ntestified that Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s overall job performance was deficient in the following ways:  n  nThe Express Mail was left -- when you do dispatch, it  xe2  x80  x99 s your  nresponsibility to clean the area to make sure everything is  ndispatched on the truck that night. So it doesn  xe2  x80  x99t matter who  ndoes dispatch, they  xe2  x80  x99re to make sure everything is on the  ntruck. And so on several occasions, [Plaintiff] left Express  nMail and it didn  xe2  x80  x99t get on the truck. It was more than one  noccasion she left Express Mail. It was more overall  nperformance. It wasn  xe2  x80  x99t just an Express Mail.  n  nIt was her overall performance issue. Breaking down mail,  nshe would break it down, then the next day she would come  nback and ask how to separate classes of mail. Scanning, we  nhad scanning issues on several occasions. She misscanned  n260 packages one day. The next day she missed 200  nmisscanning packages. She would make the truck late on  n  n12A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 13 of 39  n  nseveral occasions for the dispatch. So, you know, you want  nto get the truck loaded and it gets to the plant so your mail  ngets out timely. [A]nd complaining, she constantly  ncomplained a lot about she was working too many hours or  nnot enough hours or she was coming in too early or coming  nin too late. So it was pretty much overall -- you know, all her  nperformance...  n  n(Doc. 38-2 at 14-15, 17).  n  nOn March 18, 2014, Ms. Garrett issued Plaintiff a Letter of Warning for failure  nto follow instructions. (Doc. 40-3 at 2). The letter stated that on March 15, 2014,  nPlaintiff had mis-scanned packages   xe2  x80  x9cprepaid acceptance  xe2  x80  x9d instead of   xe2  x80  x9carrival at unit,  xe2  x80  x9d  nand Plaintiff had admitted doing so. (Li). The letter stated that as a result of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s  nfailure to scan packages properly, the Woodstock Post Office was placed on a non-  ncompliant list. (Li). The letter warned that future deficiencies would result in more  nsevere disciplinary action being taken against her, including suspensions, reduction in  ngrade and/or pay, or removal from the Postal Service. The letter informed Plaintiff that  nshe had a right to file a grievance under the grievance/arbitration procedure set forth in  nArticle 15 of the National Agreement within 14 days of her receipt of the letter. (Li).  nThe warning letter was later rescinded pursuant to a settlement agreement between  n  nSherry Garrett, on behalf of the USPS, and William Stephens, on behalf of the  n  nAmerican Postal Workers Union, due to noncompliance with Article 16 of the collective  n  n13A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 14 of 39  n  nbargaining agreement and the USPS-APWU J 0th Contract Interpretation Manual  n  n(  xe2  x80  x9cJCIM  xe2  x80  x9d). (Doc. 40-3 at 1; Moten Dep. at 60).  nOn March 19, 2014, Ms. Garrett spoke with Postmaster Ledford about Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s  njob performance and possible termination. (Doc. 40-2 at 3, 9-10; Doc. 38-2 at 7-8).  nOn March 21, 2014, Plaintiff sent another email to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal. (Doc. 38-1 at  n24). Plaintiff thanked her for the opportunity to work at the Woodstock Post Office,  nsaid that she was relocating very soon to Atlanta, and asked if there were any transfer  noptions available at that time or other positions that Plaintiff qualified for. Plaintiff  n  nclosed by stating that she would continue to check USPS listings daily. (Id.; Moten  n  n   n  nDep. at 95).  n  nOn March 22, 2014, Plaintiff reported to work as scheduled. (Moten Dep. at 93).  nAround 10:30 am, Sherry Garrett asked Plaintiff to report to Garrett  xe2  x80  x99s office, where  nthey met with Ms. Donna Vaughn, a union steward for the rural carriers. (Doc. 38-1 at  n21). Ms. Garrett commenced the meeting by telling Plaintiff that she (Garrett),  nPostmaster Todd Ledford, and Ms. Loretta Gomez were unhappy with Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s job  nperformance. (Li). Ms. Garrett explained that on Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s first day of work, she had  nleft an express mail package under her desk, and on March 19, 2014, another express  n  nmail package that she was responsible for was found in a bucket. (Li). Plaintiff denied  n  n14A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 15 of 39  n  nthat she had left any express mail packages. (Li). Ms. Garrett told Plaintiff that other  nemployees had also complained about mail being left behind.  n  nMs. Garrett gave Plaintiff the option of resigning or being terminated. In her  ndeposition, Plaintiff testified that she asked why she should resign. (Moten Dep. at 94).  nDonna Vaughn, the union steward, told her that resigning would look better than  ntermination, and it would allow Plaintiff to apply for other postal positions. (Doc. 38-1  nat 21). Plaintiff asked to see the paperwork regarding her termination and her personnel  nfolder, and was told by Ms. Garrett that they were not available and there was nothing  nin her personnel file regarding the reasons why Plaintiff was being terminated. (Moten  nDep. at 94; Doc. 38-1 at 21). Ms. Garrett then asked for Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s badge and told her  nthat she was terminated. (Moten Dep. at 94; Doc. 38-1 at 21). Plaintiff clocked out and  nwent home. (Moten Dep. at 94).  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s OPF contains a letter dated March 22, 2014,   xe2  x80  x9cSUBJECT: Termination  nof Employment,  xe2  x80  x9d stating as follows:  n  nThis is to advise you that you will be terminated during  nprobation from your position of PSE at the Woodstock Post  nOffice at the close of business on Saturday, March 22, 2014.  n  nUnder no circumstances should you work past this date.  n  nThis action is being taken due to Unsatisfactory Performance.  n  n15A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 16 of 39  n  nU.S. Postal inspectors will be notified if ID badges are not  nreturned by March 26, 2014.  n  n(Doc. 38-1 at 27; DSMF HI 15). The letter is signed by   xe2  x80  x9cSherry Garrett, [ ] Customer  nService Supervisor, Woodstock, Ga. 30188.  xe2  x80  x9d (Doc. 38-1 at 27). Plaintiff asserts that  nshe did not receive a copy of her termination letter, however, until it was faxed to her  non May 14, 2014. (Doc. 40, Pl.  xe2  x80  x99s Br. in Opp  xe2  x80  x99n, at 1; Doc. 40-2 at 4).  n  nOn Monday, March 24, 2014, Plaintiff sent an email to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal informing  nher that Plaintiff had been terminated over the weekend, and that the reason given for  nterminating her was that her performance was not what the Postmaster and her  nsupervisors were looking for. (Doc. 40-2 at 19). Plaintiff explained that Sherry Garrett  nhad offered to allow Plaintiff to resign, but Plaintiff had declined, so Garrett terminated  nher. Plaintiff noted that things had gotten   xe2  x80  x9cpretty hostile  xe2  x80  x9d after her letter of concern  n(i.e., Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s March 3, 2014 email to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal) was received. Plaintiff stated,  n  xe2  x80  x9cI don  xe2  x80  x99t know if this termination will hurt my chances of ever being employed [at] the  nPost Office [but] [i]f I  xe2  x80  x99m still eligible for re-hire I will continue to apply.  xe2  x80  x9d (Li).  n  nA few days later, Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal contacted Plaintiff and told her that there was a  nposition available at the Crown Road facility, and she could find out more about it if  n  nPlaintiff was interested. (Moten Dep. at 95). Plaintiff expressed an interest in returning  n  nto the USPS. (Ld. at 96). When Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal got back to Plaintiff with a more detailed  n  n16A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 17 of 39  n  nexplanation of what the job would involve, Plaintiff learned that she would be working  nthe third shift at Crown Road, she would have to serve a new 90-day probationary  nperiod, and Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal could not guarantee that Plaintiff would never be laid off for  nlack of work like in the past. However, the position was immediately available, and Ms.  nO  xe2  x80  x99Neal offered to reassign Plaintiff to the Crown Road facility in lieu of termination.  n  n(Id.; Doc. 38-1 at 25). Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal told Plaintiff that under the reas signment, Plaintiff  n  n   n  nwould retain her leave computation date and her NTE date would remain J anuary 6,  n2015. (DSMF   xe2  x80  x98][ 7).  n  nAfter thinking about the offer for several days, Plaintiff declined Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal  xe2  x80  x99s  noffer to reassign her to the Crown Road facility. (Moten Dep. at 96-97). Plaintiff told  nMs. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal that she felt like she had been wrongfully terminated; that she did not want  nto start back on a new 90-day probationary period; that if she lost her seniority, she  nwould be at risk of being laid off due to lack of work and probably would be the first  nto go. Under those circumstances, and without any guaranties that Plaintiff would not  nbe laid off or exempted from the 90-day probationary period requirement, Plaintiff told  nMs. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal that she could not accept the reassignment. (I_d at 97).  n  nOn or about April 8, 2014, Plaintiff filed a claim of discrimination with the USPS  n  nEqual Employment Opportunity (  xe2  x80  x9cEEO  xe2  x80  x9d) office. (Doc. 38-1 at 12). Plaintiff claimed  n  n17A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 18 of 39  n  nthat she was disparately treated, harassed, subj ected to a hostile work environment, and  ndiscriminated against 011 the basis of her race (black) and seX (female) when, on  nFebruary 8, 2014, she was not issued a scan guard for scanning mail; she was falsely  naccused of leaving an express mail package at the office; on unspecified dates in  nFebruary, she worked ten hours of overtime, but was not paid for those hours; on  nMarch 3, 2014, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Human Resources about harassment at the  nWoodstock Post Office, and management reduced Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s work hours from six hours  nto three hours a day; on March 22, 2014, management told Plaintiff that she was  nterminated from the USPS; and Plaintiff never received anything from the USPS  nregarding her termination. (I_d.).  n  nAn inquiry was conducted, and Postmaster Ledford and Bridget 0  xe2  x80  x99 Neal provided  nresponses to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s claims. (Doc. 38-1 at 12). Sherry Garrett was interviewed by  na union representative about the reasons for terminating Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s employment. (Doc.  n40-2 at 5-12 [  xe2  x80  x9cGarrett Interview  xe2  x80  x9d]). After the inquiry was concluded, Plaintiff was  ninformed that there was no resolution to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s request for counseling, and she had  nthe option to file a formal complaint, which apparently Plaintiff did. (Doc. 38-1 at 1,  n8, 13). After Plaintiff filed her formal complaint, there was an investigation of her  n  nclaims. An investigative report was prepared, and a hearing was conducted on May 20,  n  n18A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 19 of 39  n  n2015 before an administrative judge. (Doc. 38-2). Portions of the investigative report  n(  xe2  x80  x9cROI  xe2  x80  x9d) and the transcript of the administrative hearing have been submitted as  nattachments to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 38). Plaintiff has  nalso submitted several pages from the ROI in support of her claims. (Docs. 40-1  nthrough 40-4).  n  nSometime between May 20, 2014 and September 28, 2015, Lana Layton, the  nadministrative judge that conducted the administrative hearing in Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Equal  nEmployment Opportunity case, issued a decision finding that Plaintiff had failed to  nshow that she was the Victim of illegal discrimination. (Doc. 3 at 11). Plaintiff was  nnotified of the agency  xe2  x80  x99 s final decision of no-discrimination on or about October 1, 2015,  nand Plaintiff was issued a notice of right to sue letter. (Li at 11-12).  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s complaint in this case was docketed on January 5, 2016. (Doc. 3,  nC0mp1.). After the extended discovery period closed, Defendant filed the instant  nmotion for summary judgment. (Doc. 35). The motion has been fully briefed and is  n  nbefore the Court for consideration.  n  n19A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 20 of 39  n  nV. DISCUSSION  nA. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Claims  n  nIn her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she is asserting the following claims under  nTitle VII: (1) discrimination based on sex; (2) discrimination based on race;  n(3) harassment; (4) retaliation; and (5) wrongful termination. (Doc. 3, Comp1., at 7).  nThe complaint, however, contains very few factual allegations in support of these  nclaims.  n  nIn its motion for summary judgment, Defendant states that during Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  ndeposition, Plaintiff clarified Which of her allegations constitute claims and Which are  nbackgroundinformation. (Doc. 35-1 at 1-3). According to Defendant, Plaintifftestified  nthat she is asserting two disparate treatment claims, one harassment claim, and two  nretaliation claims. In Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s response brief, she has not challenged Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s  nas sertion or summary of her relevant deposition testimony, or notified the Court that she  ndisagrees With Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s summary of her claims. Accordingly, the Court Will address  neach of the claims asserted by Plaintiff in her complaint and in her deposition, as  n  naddressed by Defendant in its motion for summary judgment.  n  n20A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv-04515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 3 of 39  n  nRule 6(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:  n  nWhen an act may or must be done Within a specified time, the  ncourt may, for good cause, extend the time:  n  n(A) With or Without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a  n  nrequest is made, before the original time or its extension  n  nexpires; or  n  n(B) on motion made after the time has expired if the party  n  nfailed to act because of excusable neglect.  nFed.

Mazda Motor C0;p., 123 F.3d 1353,  n1366 (11th Cir. 1997).  n  nDefendant opposes Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s motion for an extension on the ground that she has  nfailed to show good cause or excusable neglect for filing her response after the deadline  npassed. (Doc. 41 at 1 n.1).  n  nAfter due consideration, in light of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s pro se status, and because neither  nDefendant nor the efficiency ofjudicial administration has been prejudiced by the delay,  nI have decided to exercise my discretion to accept and consider Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s out-of-time  n  nresponse to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  n  nMotion to Extend (Doc. 39) is GRANTED nunc pro tunc.A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 21 of 39  n  nB. Disparate Treatment Claims  n  nPlaintiff is as serting two claims of disparate treatment under Title VII. Disparate  ntreatment claims, brought under Title VII, require proof of discriminatory intent.  nVessels V. Atlanta Indep_. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 767-68 (11th Cir. 2005). Where, like  nhere, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, there are several ways a plaintiff can  n  nshow discriminatory intent using indirect or circumstantial evidence. Hamilton V.  n  nSouthland Christian Sch. Inc., 680 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir. 2012). One way is  n  n   n  nthrough the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Cog; V. Green,  n411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973) and Texas Department of Community Affairs V. Burdine,  n450 U.S. 248 (1981). I_d.  n  nThe McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework requires the plaintiff to  n  ncreate an inference of discrimination through his or her prima facie case. See  n  nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04; Springer V. Convergys Customer Mgmt.  n  nGroup, Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir. 2007).   xe2  x80  x9c[O]nce the plaintiff has made out  nthe elements of the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a  nnon-discriminatory basis for its employment action.  xe2  x80  x9d Springer, 509 F.3d at 1347 (citing  n  nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 253). If the employer does so, the presumption is eliminated, and  n  n   n  nthe plaintiff is given an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that  n  n21A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 22 of 39  n  nthe legitimate reason offered by the employer is a pretext for discrimination. Ld. The  nfocused inquiry in the last step requires the plaintiff to demonstrate   xe2  x80  x9csuch weaknesses,  nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, 0r contradictions in the employer  xe2  x80  x99 s  nproffered legitimate reasons for its action(s) that a reasonable factfinder could find them  nunworthy of credence.  xe2  x80  x9d RiouX V. City of Atlanta, 520 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2008)  n(citing Combs V. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (internal  nquotation marks and citation 0mitted)). At all times, the plaintiff retains the ultimate  n  nburden of persuading the finder of fact that the defendant acted with discriminatory  n  nintent. Burdine, 450 US. at 253.  n  n   n  nTo establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment under the  nMcDonnell Douglas framework, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is a  nmember of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she was  nsubj ected to an adverse employment action; and (4) she was replaced by or treated less  nfavorably than someone similarly situated outside her protected classification. E  nWilson V. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1091 (11th Cir. 2004); Coutu V. Martin  nCounty Bd. of County Comm  xe2  x80  x99rs, 47 F.3d 1068, 1073 (11th Cir. 1995).  n  nAnother way to show discriminatory intent using indirect or circumstantial  n  nevidence is by   xe2  x80  x9cpresent[ing] circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue  n  n22A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 23 of 39  n  nconcerning the employer  xe2  x80  x99s discriminatory intent.  xe2  x80  x9d Smith V. Lockheed-Martin C0;p.,  n644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). As the Eleventh Circuit has held,   xe2  x80  x9c[a] triable  nissue of fact exists if the record, Viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,  npresents   xe2  x80  x98a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to  ninfer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.  xe2  x80  x9d  xe2  x80  x99 Li. (quoting Silverman V. Bd.  nof Educ. of City of Chicago, 637 F.3d 729, 734 (7th Cir. 2011) (footnote 0mitted)).  n  xe2  x80  x9c[E]stab1ishing the elements of the McDonnell Douglas framework is not, and never  nwas intended to be, the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment  nmotion in an employment discrimination case. Rather, the plaintiff will always  nsurvive summary judgment if [s]he presents circumstantial evidence that creates a  n  ntriable is sue concerning the employer  xe2  x80  x99 3 discriminatory intent.  xe2  x80  x9d Smith, 644 F.3d at 1328  n  n   n  n(citation omitted).  n  n1. Sex and Race Discrimination with Regard to Express Mail  n  nPlaintiff alleges in her complaint that she was treated differently than her white  ncounterparts at the Woodstock Post Office. (Compl. at 7). Plaintiff testified that a  nwhite, male coworker, Seth Talley, another PSE who worked at the Woodstock Post  n  nOffice, is her comparator for her disparate treatment claim based on seX and race.  n  n(Moten Dep. at 46-47, 69, 76-77, 85). Plaintiff testified that her supervisor, Ms. Garrett,  n  n23A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 24 of 39  n  ntreated Plaintiff differently than Seth Talley when Ms. Garrett accused Plaintiff of  nfailing to dispatch express mail and gave that as one of the reasons Plaintiff was being  nterminated. Plaintiff testified that it had to have been Talley, not she, who left the  nexpress mail package around the date of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s termination because she was not at  nwork on the day she was accused of having left the package. (I_d. at 77-80).  n  nPlaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of sex or race discrimination  nbased on disparate treatment. Plaintiff has not provided or pointed to any evidence in  nthe record showing that Talley ever failed to dispatch express mail, or that if he did fail  nto dispatch express mail, that he was not reprimanded or held responsible for that  nfailure. Ms. Garrett testified that she was the supervisor on duty at the times in  nquestion, and she had personal knowledge that Plaintiff was assigned dispatch duty on  nthose days. (Doc. 38-2 at 15-16). Ms. Garrett further testified that to her knowledge,  nTalley never missed scans, never forgot to dispatch any express mail, and his overall  nperformance was good. (Ld. at 18). Plaintiff has submitted no evidence that contradicts  n0r controverts this testimony. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence  nshowing that Mr. Talley was treated more favorably than she with regard to  n  nmishandling express mail.  n  n24A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 25 of 39  n  nEven if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s disparate treatment  nclaim still fails because the USPS has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason  nfor counseling Plaintiff about not properly dispatching express mail: i.e., Ms. Garrett  nwas on duty with Plaintiff at the relevant times, and determined that Plaintiff was  nresponsible for dispatch. The express mail did not go out, and Ms. Garrett concluded  nthat Plaintiff was responsible. Plaintiff has failed to show that Ms. Garrett  xe2  x80  x99 s  nexplanation for confronting Plaintiff about the express mail was pretext for race or seX  ndiscrimination. Plaintiff has also failed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence to  ncreate a triable issue concerning the employer  xe2  x80  x99s discriminatory intent.  n  nFinally, Plaintiff has failed to present any argument in opposition to summary  njudgment on her express mail disparate treatment claim. In this district, failure to  nrespond to arguments relating to a claim in the plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s initial response to the motion  nconstitutes abandonment of the claim. & Wilkerson V. Grinnell Cogp., 270 F.3d 1314,  n1322 (11th Cir. 2001) (deeming claim abandoned where argument was not presented  n  nin initial response to motion for summary judgment); see also White V. Ga.

Ga.  nMay 19, 2006) (  xe2  x80  x9c[I]t is well-accepted in this district that the failure to respond to  n  narguments relating to a claim constitutes abandonment of the claim  xe2  x80  x9d).  n  n25A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 26 of 39  n  nFor the reasons stated, I recommend that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary  njudgment be granted on Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s disparate treatment claim With regard to express  nmail.  n  n2. Race Discrimination with Regard to Scan Guards  n  nPlaintiff next contends that Ms. Garrett treated her differently than her White  ncoworker, Denise Reinagel, When Ms. Garrett failed to provide Plaintiff With a scan  nguard to help prevent scanning errors. (Moten Dep. at 70-73).  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s scan guard disparate treatment claim lacks a factual 0r evidentiary  nbasis. Plaintiff testified that near the end of her employment at the Woodstock Post  nOffice, Plaintiff learned that there was something called a scan guard that could be used  nto help prevent scanning errors. (Ld. at 71). Plaintiff testified that at some unidentified  ntime, Ms. Reinagel told Plaintiff that she had used a scan guard. (Ld. at 72). However,  nPlaintiff also testified that Plaintiff never asked for a scan guard, and she never saw  nMs. Reinagel use one, even though she and Ms. Reinagle worked on the same shift at  nleast 90 percent of the time. (Li). Plaintiff further testified that she did not know Where  nscan guards were stored, if scan guards were a piece of equipment that employees had  n  nto sign out, or that she had any knowledge about scan guards beyond her understanding  n  n26A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 27 of 39  n  nthat they were available or should have been available like any other equipment. (Ld.  nat 72-73).  n  nPlaintiff has not satisfied the elements of a prima facie case of disparate treatment  nwith regard to not being provided a scan guard. Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence  ntending to show that Ms. Garrett or anyone else at the Woodstock Post Office ever  nissued Ms. Reinagle (or any other employee) a scan guard. Ms. Garrett testified that in  nten years, she has never issued a scan guard to any employee. (Doc. 38-2 at 16).  nAccording to the USPS   xe2  x80  x99 s EEO office, Postmaster Ledford also reported that none of the  nWoodstock clerks used a scan guard to scan mail. (Doc. 38-1 at 18). Plaintiff herself  ntestified that she never observed any employee at the Woodstock Post Office use a scan  nguard, and she never asked anyone if she could have or use a scan guard. (Moten Dep.  nat 71-72). Plaintiff argues that Postmaster Ledford testified that scan guards were  nordered after Plaintiff was terminated, but this argument undermines rather than  nsupports her contention that she was disparately treated. (Doc. 40 at 2; Doc. 40-2 at  n16).  n  nPlaintiff has failed to show that Ms. Reinagle was treated more favorably than  nshe. Plaintiff has also failed to show that not being issued a scan guard was pretextual  n  nfor race discrimination.  n  n27A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 28 of 39  n  nFor the reasons stated, I recommend that summary judgment be granted on  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s disparate treatment claims.  n  nC. Harassment Claim  n  nPlaintiff next alleges that Loretta Gomez harassed her, that Plaintiff complained  nabout the alleged harassment to Human Resources, but the USPS failed to address her  ncomplaints and failed to follow its anti-harassment procedure. (Doc. 40 at 1; Moten  nDep. at 74, 82-83).  n  nThe employee has the burden of proving a hostile work environment claim based  non harassment. & Edwards V. Wallace Cmty. C011., 49 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.  n1995). In order to set forth a prima facie case, a plaintiff must demonstrate the  nfollowing essential elements: (1) that she belongs to a protected group; (2) that she has  nbeen subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment was based on a  nprotected characteristic; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to  nalter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive  n  nworking environment; and (5) that there is a basis for holding the employer liable for  n  nthe harassment.   xef  xac  x82 Furcron V.

Forklift Sys, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (Citing Meritor SaV.  nBank V. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986)); Sykes V. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., 128  nF. App  xe2  x80  x99X 100, 101 (11th Cir. 2005). The   xe2  x80  x9csevere and pervasive  xe2  x80  x9d element contains both  nan objective and a subjective component. To be actionable, the challenged conduct  nmust create an environment that is both obj ectively hostile or abusive (the reasonable  n  nperson standard) and an environment that the plaintiff herself perceives to be abusive  n  n(the subjective standard). Miller, 277 F.3d at 1276.  n  n   n  nIn determining whether an environment is   xe2  x80  x9chostile  xe2  x80  x9d or   xe2  x80  x9cabusive,  xe2  x80  x9d the court must  nconsider the entirety of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory  nconduct; its severity; Whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere  noffensive utterance; and Whether it unreasonably interferes With an employee  xe2  x80  x99s work  n  nperformance. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.

(Moten Dep. at 74, 82, 91; Doc. 38-1 at  n23). Plaintiff alleged in her email that Loretta Gomez was harassing Plaintiff by making  nit impossible for her to complete her dispatch because, instead of letting Plaintiff load  nthe truck near the end of her workday, Gomez was making Plaintiff re-do a scan that she  nhad performed earlier in the day, even though other employees were available to do the  nscan. (Doc. 38-1 at 23). Plaintiff confirmed in her deposition that she was not alleging  nthat Gomez  xe2  x80  x99 s harassment was due to race, seX, or any other protected status covered by  nTitle VII. (Moten Dep. at 91-92). Rather, Plaintiff testified that the alleged harassment  nconsisted of Ms. Gomez yelling and screaming at her about doing different work details.  n(Ld. at 83, 109). Plaintiff further contends that her termination was based, at least in  npart, on a report from Ms. Gomez that she was   xe2  x80  x9cunhappy  xe2  x80  x9d with Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s job  nperformance. (Ld. at 83, 109; Doc. 40 at 2; Doc. 40-2 at 3).  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s harassment claim fails for several reasons. First, Plaintiff has not  n  nargued or established that requiring her to re-do a scan or scans constitutes an adverse  n  n3OA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv-04515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 4 of 39  n  nII.

Plaintiff cites to a   xef  xac  x82ow chart for management inquiry procedures to support  nher harassment claim (Doc. 40 at 1-2; Doc. 40-4 at 10), but she has pointed to no  n  nevidence showing or even tending to show that Loretta Gomez  xe2  x80  x99s alleged hostility or  n  n31A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 32 of 39  n  nharassment was in any way motivated by a discriminatory animus regarding Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s  nrace or gender, or any other protected characteristic.  n  nPlaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of harassment/hostile work  nenvironment. She has also failed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence to create  na triable issue concerning her employer  xe2  x80  x99s discriminatory intent. For all the reasons  nstated, I recommend that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  nharassment claim be granted.  n  nD. Retaliation Claims  n  nTo establish a claim of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must allege and  nshow that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse  nemployment action; and (3) there was some causal relation between the two events.  nGoldsmith V. Bagby Elevator C0., 513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir. 2008). To establish  nthe causal connection element, a plaintiff need only show that the protected activity and  nthe adverse action were not Wholly unrelated. Clover V. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176  nF.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir. 1999). The causation element may be shown by the  ntemporal proximity of the complaint to the adverse employment action. Thomas V.  nCooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007). However, the timing of  n  n,  n  nthe events must be   xe2  x80  x9cvery close.  xe2  x80  x99 Li.

If the employer does so, the presumption is  neliminated, and the plaintiff is given an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the  nevidence that the legitimate reason offered by the employer is a pretext for  ndiscrimination. Ld. At all times, the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuading  n  nthe finder of fact that the defendant acted With discriminatory intent. Burdine, 450 US.  n  n   n  nat 253, 101 S.

Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the   xe2  x80  x9cprotected  n  nactivity was a but  xe2  x80  x94for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer.  xe2  x80  x9d See  n  nUniversity of Texas SW.

An act of participation requires the existence of a Title VII  nproceeding or investigation. Li. (citing Clover V. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346,  n1353 (11th Cir. 1999)). Making informal complaints to superiors about suspected  nillegal discrimination may also qualify as protected expression, but such complaints are  nprotected under the opposition clause of Title VII. Li. (citing Holifield V. Reno, 115  nF.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir. 1997)).  n  nIn this case, Plaintiff testified in her deposition that she is asserting two discrete  nretaliation claims. She claims that after she complained to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal about her work  nconcerns on March 3, 2014, the USPS retaliated against her by drastically reducing her  nhours starting March 10, 2014 (Moten Dep. at 80-81); then the USPS retaliated against  nher by terminating her employment on March 22, 2014. (Li. at 79).  n  nPlaintiff has not pointed to any evidence in the record suggesting that she  nparticipated in any formal investigation or proceeding before she was terminated on  nMarch 22, 2014. The record shows that she did not file a complaint With the EEO office  nuntil April 2014. Accordingly, the Court will assume that Plaintiff is asserting that  n  nsending her email to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal on March 3, 2014 was protected activity.  n  n34A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 35 of 39  n  nMaking informal complaints to superiors about suspected illegal discrimination  n  nmay qualify as protected expression under the opposition clause of Title VII.

Of Law Enforcement, 868 F.2d 397, 400 (11th Cir. 1989) (  xe2  x80  x9c[W]e recognize that  nthe protection afforded by the statute is not limited to individuals Who have filed formal  ncomplaints, but extends as well to those, like [the plaintiff], who informally voice  ncomplaints to their superiors  xe2  x80  x9d). Nevertheless, not every informal complaint made by  n  nan employee automatically qualifies as a protected expression that shields the employee  n  nfrom subsequent retaliation. White, 2006 WL 2443848, at *25.  n  n   n  nFor an employee  xe2  x80  x99s opposition activity to be protected under the anti-retaliation  nprovision of Title VII, the employee must be opposing conduct that is made an  n  xe2  x80  x9cunlawful employment practice  xe2  x80  x9d by Title VII. I_d. Title VII defines an   xe2  x80  x9cunlawful  nemployment practice  xe2  x80  x9d as, inter alia, discrimination against an employee   xe2  x80  x9cWith respect  nto his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such  nindividual  xe2  x80  x99s race, color, religion, seX, or national origin.  xe2  x80  x9d 42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 2000e-2(a).  nIn other words, it is not enough for a plaintiff to show that she opposed garden-variety  nunfairness or harsh treatment in the workplace; she is only protected from retaliation if  n  nthe practice she opposed or complained about is specifically prohibited by Title VII.  n  n35A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 36 of 39  n  nWhite, 2006 WL 2443848, at *26.  n  n   n  nWith regard to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s reduction-in-hours claim, Plaintiff testified that she felt  nlike she was treated differently than her comparator, Seth Talley. (Moten Dep. at 80-82,  n85-86). The record shows that for several weeks before Plaintiff sent her March 3, 2014  nemail, Plaintiff was complaining that her hours were too long. On or about March 10,  n2014, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s hours were reduced. Plaintiff then became concerned that the  nreduction in her work hours was too drastic and she was not being given the same time  nto complete her dispatch as her white male counterpart, Seth Talley. (Moten Dep. at 80,  n85; Doc. 38-1 at 8). Plaintiff claims that her hours were reduced in retaliation for  nvoicing her concerns about her work situation.  n  nDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s uncontroverted evidence shows that between March 10, 2014 and  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s termination on the 22nd, Plaintiff worked twelve days, while PSE Talley  nworked nine days. (DSMF HI 19). Plaintiff worked 92.19 hours during this period, and  n  nPSE Talley worked 68.22 hours. (Id.; Doc. 38-1 at 29-34, 35-38). During the days both  n  n   n  nPlaintiff and Talley worked the same day, Plaintiff worked 71.74 hours, while Talley  n  nworked 68.22. (DSMF HI 20). In her response brief, Plaintiff concedes that the record  nshows she worked more hours than Talley did. (Doc. 40 at 2).  n  nWith regard to her termination, it is undisputed that Plaintiff suffered an adverse  n  n36A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 37 of 39  n  nemployment action when she was terminated on March 22, 2014. However, Plaintiff  nhas failed to show that she opposed conduct that is specifically prohibited by Title VII.  nPlaintiff admitted in her deposition that her March 3rd email to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal did not  nconstitute an internal complaint of race- or gender-based discrimination under Title VII.  n(Moten Dep. at 91-92). It is undisputed that the email sent by Plaintiff to Ms. O  xe2  x80  x99Neal  ndid not reference Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s race, gender, or other protected classification. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  nemail raised concerns regarding the lack of a time card, schedule changes, long hours,  nand treatment by Loretta Gomez, but did not allege that these issues were due to any  ntype of discrimination or discriminatory conduct prohibited by Title VII. Plaintiff has  nfailed to show that she engaged in any protected activity prior to the reduction in her  nhours and her separation from the Woodstock Post Office.  n  nIn sum, Plaintiff has failed to establish that her work hours were reduced more  nthan Talley  xe2  x80  x99 s, or that Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s hours were reduced for retaliatory purposes. Plaintiff  nhas also failed to show that she engaged in any protected activity, much less a causal  nconnection between such activity and her discharge. For the reasons stated,  nI recommend that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s retaliation  n  nclaims be granted.  n  n37A0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 38 of 39  n  nE. Other Contentions  n  nFinally, Plaintiff does not allege in her Complaint but argues in her response brief  nthat she was wrongfully terminated because she was not a probationary employee at the  ntime of her discharge. (Doc. 40 at 2). Plaintiff, however, has failed to point to or  nprovide any probative evidence that would support such a claim. The only evidence  nshe has submitted to support her assertion is an unsigned, unauthenticated, undated  nstatement of union contentions in an earlier proceeding asserting that Plaintiff was not  na probationary employee and her termination violated certain contractual obligations  nbetween the union and the USPS. (Doc. 40-4 at 1-3). The statement does not mention  nTitle VII or assert that Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s termination was in any way discriminatory or  nretaliatory on the basis of race, seX, or any other protected characteristic.  n  nIn addition to being unauthenticated, inadmissible hearsay, this evidence is not  nprobative of whether Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s reasons for terminating Plaintiff were a cloak for race  nor seX discrimination. Plaintiff has made no attempt to link her contention that she was  nnot a probationary employee to her Title VII claims. Nor has Plaintiff provided  nsufficient probative evidence showing that Ms. Garrett  xe2  x80  x99 s reasons for terminating  nPlaintiff were implausible or not worthy of belief. Plaintiff has also failed to show how  n  nthe record evidence creates a genuine is sue of material fact as to intent or pretext, based  n  n38Case 1:15-cv  xe2  x80  x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 39 of 39  n  non the nature of the reasons offered in combination With other circumstantial evidence.  nReeves V.

According to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s records, Plaintiff  nhad not completed her 90-day probationary period for her last temporary appointment  nbefore she was removed from her position at the Woodstock Post Office.1 (DSMF   xe2  x80  x98][  xe2  x80  x98][ 9-  n10).  n  nAt all relevant times, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s direct supervisor at the Woodstock Post Office  n  nwas Sherry Garrett; the postmaster was Todd Ledford; Loretta Gomez was a supervisor;  n  n1 In her response brief, Plaintiff argues that she was wrongfully terminated  nbecause she was not a probationary employee at the time of her discharge.

During Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s tenure at the Woodstock  nPost Office, Plaintiff was the only black female working as a PSE Mail Processing  nClerk.

(Doc. 38-1 at 23; Moten Dep. at 81-82, 84).  n  nAfter several weeks had passed With no changes being made, Plaintiff sent an  nemail to Bridget O  xe2  x80  x99Neal in Human Resources on March 3, 2014 raising the same  nconcerns that Plaintiff had voiced to Ms. Garrett about What Plaintiff considered to be  nunfair treatment at the Woodstock Post Office.

This Court dismissed all but one of the plaintiffs in Ba_iley for misjoinder.  nOn October 13, 2010, Plaintiff Harris electronically signed and   xef  xac  x81led a petition  nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in the District of Maryland.  nEven though she had opted in to the Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch class action and was a named Plaintiff  nin Bailey, Plaintiff Harris did not include her claims against Gentiva in the schedule  nof assets that she   xef  xac  x81led in the bankruptcy court. On June 27, 2011, Plaintiff   xef  xac  x81led  namended schedules with the bankruptcy court, but again failed to include her claims  nagainst Gentiva. On J uly 5, 201 1, the bankruptcy court entered an order discharging  nPlaintiff s debt. Plaintiff   xef  xac  x81led two additional amended schedules (on J uly 13,  n2011and March 4, 2013 respectively), but again failed to include her claims against  n  nGentiva. On December 9, 2013, the bankruptcy court closed her case. On April 23,  n  n2015, Plaintiff Harris   xef  xac  x81led this lawsuit.A0 72A  n(Rev.8/BZ)  n  nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 846 Filed 09/08/16 Page 3 of 7  n  nOn August 17, 2010, Plaintiff Gibson   xef  xac  x81led a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy  nin the Northern District of Alabama. Plaintiff Gibson likewise did not include her  nclaims against Gentiva in her schedule of assets and never amended her schedules to  ninclude these claims. On December 29, 2010, the bankruptcy court discharged  nPlaintiff Gibson  xe2  x80  x99s debts under Chapter 7. On September 6, 201 1, after she opted into  nthe Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch class action, Plaintiff Gibson   xef  xac  x81led a second bankruptcy petition   xe2  x80  x94 this  ntime for reorganization under Chapter 11. She   xef  xac  x81led her schedules on September 30,  n2011, and, again, she did not include her claims against Gentiva or amend her  nschedules to do so. On October 19, 2011, Plaintiff Gibson re-  xef  xac  x81led her schedules in  nher bankruptcy, but did not include her claims against Gentiva. The bankruptcy court  nultimately dismissed Plaintiff Gibson  xe2  x80  x99s Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy case on December 10,  n2012, and closed the case on December 26, 2012. Plaintiff Gibson never amended her  npleadings to identify her claims against Gentiva. On May 5, 2015, Plaintiff Gibson  n  n  xef  xac  x81led her pending suit against Gentiva.  n  nDiscussion  nAs noted above, Defendant asserts that it is entitled to judgment With respect  nto Plaintiffs Harris  xe2  x80  x99 and Gibson  xe2  x80  x99s suits because Plaintiffs do not have standing to  n  npursue their claims because those claims became the property of the bankruptcy estate,A0 72A  n(Rev.8l82)  n  nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 846 Filed 09/08/16 Page 4 of 7  n  nLC.

This  nCourt, however, concludes that Defendant is incorrect.  n  nIn the Order of March 23, 2016, [Doc. 804 in Case No. 1:15-CV-55555], this  nCourt held that the two-year statute of limitations applies to the Fair Labor Standards  nAct suits pending in this Court against Defendant. Accordingly, Plaintiff Harris  xe2  x80  x99  nclaims to overtime pay are limited to those workweeks beginning on April 23, 2013,  nand Plaintiff Gibson  xe2  x80  x99s claims begin on May 5, 2013. There is no indication that these  nPlaintiffs intend to argue that they are entitled to any type of equitable tolling based  non what happened in Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch and Biiley, and, if they did, Defendant would  ncertainly argue strenuously (and rightfully) that these are entirely new cases and there  n  nis no basis to conclude that Plaintiffs are entitled to tolling because of the earlier failed  n  ncases. This Court thus concludes that it would likewise be improper to look back atA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 846 Filed 09/08/16 Page 5 of 7  n  nwhat happened in those earlier cases to determine what Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 duties and rights  nwere with respect to their claims as they relate to their bankruptcy actions.  nAccordingly, this Court will ignore Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch and Ba_iley in analyzing the parties  xe2  x80  x99  narguments.  n  nTurning   xef  xac  x81rst to the question of Plaintiff Harris  xe2  x80  x99 claims, she   xef  xac  x81led her suit well  nafter she   xef  xac  x81led her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and the fact that her bankruptcy case  nlingered beyond the date that she   xef  xac  x81led her suit here is of no consequence because, as  na general matter, Chapter 7 debtors retain possession of property   xe2  x80  x94 including legal  n  nclaims   xe2  x80  x94  xe2  x80  x94-- acquired after they   xef  xac  x81le their bankruptcy petition.

A legal claim arising after a Chapter  n  n   n  n7 debtor   xef  xac  x81les for bankruptcy would be included in the bankruptcy estate only if the  n  nclaim is   xe2  x80  x9csuf  xef  xac  x81ciently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past.  xe2  x80  x9d Segal V.

In that same  norder, J udge J ones struck the testimony of the plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 expert. In another order, i_Q1_.  ndoc. 785, Judge J ones concluded that the accurate measure of the Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 damages  n  nwould be half  xe2  x80  x94time pay for the hours that the plaintiffs worked in excess of forty in  n  n1 For a complete discussion of the PPV Plan, gee Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch V.

Defendant has   xef  xac  x81led a motion in the cases pending before the  nundersigned seeking an order adopting these rulings by J udge J ones. [Doc. 623].  n  nAt the outset, this Court disagrees with Defendant that the law of the case  ndoctrine applies to Judge Jones  xe2  x80  x99 rulings. Under that doctrine, a ruling made in a  ncertain case remains binding on the parties in that case. Rind  xef  xac  x82eish orders made after  ndeserti  xef  xac  x81cation of the class in that case are not binding on these cases. However, this  nCourt agrees with Plaintiffs that it can construe Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion as one seeking  nsummary judgment on the issues raised, and for obvious reasons of j udicial ef  xef  xac  x81ciency,  nthis Court Will do just that. In such event, Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate the same  narguments that were raised by the plaintiffs in Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch in response to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s  nsummary judgment motions. [Doc. 640 at 4].  n  nThis Court has carefully reviewed Judge J ones  xe2  x80  x99 extensive   xef  xac  x81ndings of fact and  nthe conclusions based upon those   xef  xac  x81ndings in the two orders from Rind  xef  xac  x82eisch  nmentioned above. With one exception discussed below, this Court agrees fully with  nJ udge J ones and adopts those conclusions into this case. Accordingly, this Court now  nconcludes that (1) Defendant did not act willfully in Violating the FLSA by  nimplementing the PPV Plan, and the FLSA  xe2  x80  x99s two-year statute of limitations applies  nto Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 claims against Defendant, (2) Defendant acted in good faith in adopting  n  nthe PPV Plan so that Plaintiffs are not entitled to recover liquidated damages under theA0 72A  n(Rev.8/82)  n  nCase 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 804 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 3  n  nAct, and (3) the accurate measure of the Plaintiffs  xe2  x80  x99 damages in these cases is half  xe2  x80  x94time  npay for the hours that the plaintiffs worked in excess of forty in any one week.  n  nThis Court will not, however, adopt Judge J ones  xe2  x80  x99 stance as it relates to experts  n  xe2  x80  x94  xe2  x80  x94 at least not yet. In the order of November 24, 2016, this Court expressed its  nskepticism that expert testimony is required to resolve the issues in this case. That  nskepticism still holds, but as there does not seem to be any expert testimony to strike  nat this time, this Court will limit its holding by requiring only that the parties obtain  nleave of this Court before beginning discovery related to expert witnesses.  n  nFor the reasons stated, Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s motion, [Doc. 623], is GRANTED, and this  n  nCourt adopts Judge J ones  xe2  x80  x99 orders from the Rind  xef  xac  x82eish case as discussed.  n  nIT IS SO ORDERED, this Z7/day of March, 2016.  n  nWILLIS B.

The DOL regulations note that although the  n  nexercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that the  nemployee has authority to make an independent choice, free from  nimmediate direction or supervision . . . employees can exercise  ndiscretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or  nrecommendations are reviewed at a higher level. Thus, the term  n  xe2  x80  x9cdiscretion and independent judgment  xe2  x80  x9d does not require that the  ndecisions made by an employee have a   xef  xac  x81nality that goes With  nunlimited authority and a complete absence of review.

Based on the record evidence, Bynum, as a CCSD PD  ninvestigator, conducts investigations that necessarily involve determining Which  npotential witnesses to interview, selecting an order for the interviews, conducting  n  nthe actual interviews, following up with any leads produced during the interviews,  n  n6 In response to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Motion, Bynum disputes the accuracy of the job  ndescription and the percentage of time the job description allots t0 the investigatory  nduties versus other non-investigatory duties.

As explained in more  ndetail below, however, Bynum has not presented any evidence that the  ninvestigatory duties listed in the job description were inaccurate.  n  n16Case 1:16-cv-00001-MHC Document 44 Filed 07/10/17 Page 17 of 23  n  ncollecting other evidence, then reviewing and analyzing all of the information  ncollected to make a determination about Whether a crime occurred and whether  nprobable cause exists, and developing a recommendation as to Whether or not to  nobtain an arrest warrant.

However, a thorough examination of the evidence  nin the record does not support Bynum  xe2  x80  x99s Cherry  xe2  x80  x94picking of deposition excerpts in an  nattempt to support his limited View. More importantly, the evidence cited by  nBynum does not contradict the evidence presented by Defendant detailing the more  ncomplete picture of her job description.  n  nFor example, Bynum cites an excerpt from the deposition of her fellow  n  ninvestigator, Michelle Magwood, in Which Magwood testi  xef  xac  x81es that her  n  n17Case 1:16-cv-00001-MHC Document 44 Filed 07/10/17 Page 18 of 23  n  ninvestigatory duties as an investigator was limited to interviewing witnesses,  nsurveillance, and writing reports. Magwood Dep. at 119. However, this  ntestimony, in which another investigator chose summarily to characterize her  nparticular job duties in a concise manner, does not constitute evidence that a CCSD  nPD investigator  xe2  x80  x99s job duties did not include the full gamut of responsibilities  ndelineated in the written job description, which Bynum con  xef  xac  x81rmed were accurate  nduring her deposition. Rather, the Magwood testimony is not inconsistent with  nDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s evidence.  n  nBynum also cites deposition testimony from her supervisor, Lt. Hester, in  nwhich he describes the process of investigators interviewing witnesses as part of an  ninvestigation. E Hester Dep. at 118. Similarly, this deposition testimony does  nnot contradict Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s evidence of Bynum  xe2  x80  x99s job duties. In fact,,if one reviews  n  na more complete excerpt of the deposition testimony from Hester, see Hester Dep.  n  n   n  nat 118-22, it is clear that it is consistent with Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s position. For example, in  nresponse to a question suggesting that a CCSD PD investigator does nothing other  nthan transcribe information for others to use in making signi  xef  xac  x81cant decisions,  nHester clearly states that the investigators do not merely conduct the investigations;  n  nrather, they assess the information they collect and make recommendations as to  n  n18Case 1:16-cv-00001-MHC Document 44 Filed 07/10/17 Page 19 of 23  n  nWhether a crime occurred, Whether probable cause exists, and Whether an arrest  n  nwarrant should be sought.  n  nQ: So I get the   xef  xac  x81le.

Defendants  xe2  x80  x99 decision to terminate  nMs. Wiley on account of her protected whistleblower activity violated her clearly  nestablished free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and her  n  nrights as a public employee under the Georgia Whistleblower Act.Case 1:16  xe2  x80  x94cv  xe2  x80  x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 11 of 27  n  n37.  nDuring that conversation, Hampton also incredibly told Ms. Wiley that she  n  nneeded to justify Why she should not be placed on a leave of absence because of  n  nher lawsuit.  n38.  n  nMs. Wiley was stunned by these comments and confused as her lawsuit  nagainst her former employer had nothing to do With her employment With the City  nof Atlanta nor any public service, policy or transaction involving the City of  nAtlanta.  n  n39.  n  nUpon information and belief, Patrick shared the contents of Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s  nlawsuit With Hampton.  n  n40.  n  nPer Hampton  xe2  x80  x99s instructions, Ms. Wiley contacted Hampton  xe2  x80  x99s assistant and  nscheduled an appointment to meet With Hampton on Wednesday, J anuary 7, 2015.  n  n41.  n  nFollowing Ms. Wiley \\'s conversation With Hampton and Patrick, Ms. Wiley  n  nwas anxious and concerned that Hampton  xe2  x80  x99s response to Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s disclosure of  n  nher Whistleblower lawsuit had placed her job With the City in jeopardy, even  n  n11Case 1:16  xe2  x80  x94cv  xe2  x80  x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 12 of 27  n  nthough her lawsuit had nothing to do With the City of Atlanta or any of the duties  nthat Ms. Wiley performed for the City.  n42.  n  nThe following Monday, J anuary 5, 2015, When everyone returned to the  noffice from the holiday break, Hampton  xe2  x80  x99s assistant cancelled Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s  npreviously scheduled meeting on J anuary 7, 2015 Without any explanation.  n  n43.  n  nThroughout the morning of J anuary 5, 2015 in the office, Patrick  nuncharacteristically avoided contact With Ms. Wiley, and When they did interact,  nPatrick was cold and dismissive   xe2  x80  x94 unlike the previously warm and collegial  nrelationship that Ms. Wiley had experienced before With Patrick.  n  n44.  n  nThat same morning, Hampton convened a meeting With all of the   xe2  x80  x9cDeputies  nand Chiefs  xe2  x80  x9d in a conference room. When Ms. Wiley entered the room, Hampton  ndid not speak to her.  n  n45.  nDuring the meeting, Ms. Wiley noticed that Patrick appeared visibly upset  n  nand realized that something was seriously wrong.  n  n12Case 1:16  xe2  x80  x94cv  xe2  x80  x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 13 of 27  n  n46.  n  nImmediately after the meeting, Hampton excused everyone except Patrick  nand Robert Godfrey, the Chief Counsel who handles employment litigation for the  nCity.  n  n47.  n  nA few minutes later, Patrick called Ms. Wiley into her office, where Godfrey  nwas also waiting. In front of Godfrey, Patrick told Ms. Wiley that she was being  nterminated, effective immediately.  n  n48.  n  nMs. Wiley asked Patrick for an explanation for her termination. Patrick  nrefused to explain and coldly said over and over that Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s   xe2  x80  x9cservices were  nno longer needed.  xe2  x80  x9d When Ms. Wiley asked if she was being terminated because of  nher whistleblower lawsuit, Patrick refused to provide any further explanation for  nMs. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s abrupt termination.  n  n49.  n  nAfter Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s repeated request for an explanation for her abrupt  n  ntermination, Patrick offered Ms. Wiley the option of resigning her employment  n  nwith the City of Atlanta.  n  n13Case 1:16  xe2  x80  x94cv  xe2  x80  x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 14 of 27  n  n50.  n  nBecause Ms. Wiley had not done anything wrong and needed her job with  n  nthe City, Ms. Wiley refused to resign her employment.  n51.  n  nFollowing Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s termination, the City of Atlanta falsely reported to  nthe Georgia Department of Labor that Ms. Wiley had voluntarily resigned her  nposition.  n  n52.  n  nThe City of Atlanta has adopted a   xe2  x80  x9cBill of Rights  xe2  x80  x9d to guide the City Council,  nMayor, and all departments of City government. Section 2 0f the City  xe2  x80  x99s Bill of  nRights states that   xe2  x80  x9c[t]he City of Atlanta shall not interfere with the rights of  nfreedom of speech, of freedom of the press, to petition the government, 0r 0f  n  npeaceable assembly.  xe2  x80  x9d  n  n53.  nUnder the Atlanta Code of Ordinances (  xe2  x80  x9cCity Code  xe2  x80  x9d), Sec. 114  xe2  x80  x9484(b)(4),  nMs. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s position of Chief Counsel of Aviation was an   xe2  x80  x9cunclassi  xef  xac  x81ed  xe2  x80  x9d position  nwith the City of Atlanta. Therefore, Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s employment was not protected  nunder the civil service provisions of City Code with respect to discipline and  n  ntermination.  n  n14Case 1:16  xe2  x80  x94cv  xe2  x80  x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 15 of 27  n  n54.  n  nUnder City Code 2-397, Ms. Wiley served at the pleasure of City Attorney  nHampton, as the City Attorney served as the appointing authority for all employees  nof the Department of Law.  n  n55.  n  nMs. Wiley was terminated from her employment With the City at Hampton  xe2  x80  x99s  n  ndiscretion as the official appointing authority under the City Code.  n56.  n  nMs. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s Whistleblower lawsuit against Henry County, Georgia and the  nHenry County Board of Commissioners constitutes a matter of public concern,  nbecause Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s lawsuit brought to light governmental misconduct and a  nbreach of the public trust by certain elected officials in Henry County.  n  n57.  n  nMs. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s Whistleblower lawsuit had no impact on the effective operation  nof the City or the provision of services to the City by the Department of Law,  nbecause the City was not a party to the lawsuit and the allegations contained in the  nlawsuit had nothing to do With Ms. Wiley  xe2  x80  x99s employment With the City.

Arnold filed the above-styled civil action on J anuary 11,  n2016. Plaintiff alleges that he was employed by Defendant Stratas Foods, Inc.  n(  xe2  x80  x9cDefendant  xe2  x80  x9d 0r   xe2  x80  x9cStratas  xe2  x80  x9d) from March 25, 1999, until August 7, 2015, when his  nemployment was terminated.

For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS  n  nthat Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Motion for Summary Judgment [37] be GRANTED, and that  n  njudgment be entered in favor of Defendant.  n  n1Plaintiff   xe2  x80  x99 s first claim, for retaliation in Violation of Title VII, was dismissed for  nfailure to state a claim on August 17, 2016. See Order [28].Case 1:16-cv-00081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 2 of 35  n  nI. FACTS  n  nUnless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from  n  xe2  x80  x9cDefendant  xe2  x80  x99 s Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute  nfor Trial  xe2  x80  x9d [37-2] (  xe2  x80  x9cDef. SMF  xe2  x80  x9d) and   xe2  x80  x9cPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Response to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Statement  nof Material Facts  xe2  x80  x9d in Support of its Motion for Summary J udgment  xe2  x80  x9d [40-2] (  xe2  x80  x9cPL Resp.  nSMF  xe2  x80  x9d).  n  nAlthough Plaintiff filed his own   xe2  x80  x9cStatements of Material Fact as to Which it is  nContended There Exists a Genuine Issue Exists [sic]  xe2  x80  x9d [40-1] (  xe2  x80  x9cPL SMF  xe2  x80  x9d), these are  nnot in fact statements of fact at all. Each item is worded as a question, not a fact, and  nno citations to any evidence are offered in support of any of these questions. Thus, the  nformat violates Local Rule 56.1, and the Court does not consider either this statement  nor Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s response thereto. See LR 56.1B(1), NDGa (  xe2  x80  x9cThe court Will not  nconsider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . or (0) stated as an  nissue or legal conclusion . . . or ((1) set out only in the brief and not in the movant  xe2  x80  x99s  nstatement of undisputed facts  xe2  x80  x9d); LR 56.1B(2)(b), NDGa (a respondent  xe2  x80  x99 s brief   xe2  x80  x9cmust  nmeet the requirements set out in LR 56.1B(1)  xe2  x80  x9d).  n  nFor those facts submitted by the Defendant that are supported by citations to  nrecord evidence, and for Which the Plaintiff has not specifically disputed and refuted  n  nWith citations to admissible record evidence showing a genuine dispute of fact, theCase 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 11 of 35  n  nNeither Metzler nor anyone else at Stratas ever made comments to Plaintiff, or  naround Plaintiff, that were racist in any way. Def. SMF at HI 41. Plaintiff was the only  nperson who regularly purchased quantities of oil from other employees and who stored  nthe oil on Stratas  xe2  x80  x99s premises instead of removing it right away. Def. SMF at HI 42.  nPlaintiff believes Metzler is biased against African-Americans in part because Metzler  ndid not spend time on the   xef  xac  x82oor of the Valdosta Plant or interact with Plaintiff and the  nother employees on the packaging line. Def. SMF at HI 43. Not all employees who  nworked on the   xef  xac  x82oor of the Valdosta Plant were African-American, and Metzler treated  nall the employees on the   xef  xac  x82oor  xe2  x80  x94 whether African-American or Caucasian  xe2  x80  x94 the same  nway. Def. SMF at HI 44.  n  nIn addition, Plaintiff believes Metzler is biased against African-Americans  nbecause of the   xe2  x80  x9cbuddy club,  xe2  x80  x9d a group of employees who share an office near Metzler  xe2  x80  x99 s  non the second   xef  xac  x82oor of the Valdosta Plant. Def. SMF at HI 45. Among the employees  nwho share the office, not all of them are Caucasian. Def. SMF at HI 46. Moreover, the  noffice is generally reserved for higher ranking employees and/or employees who  nconsistently require a desk to work. Def. SMF at HI 46. Plaintiff testified that he  nprobably could have gone into the office if he had wanted to. Def. SMF at HI 47; Def.  nEX. A at 83. Defendant claims that Plaintiff also acknowledged that all the Caucasian  n  nemployees who had desks in the office had them before Metzler became the Plant  n  n11Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 12 of 35  n  nManager. Def. SMF at HI 48. Plaintiff disputes this, claiming that his testimony was  nthat a Caucasian lead operator in a different division (with presumably the same job  nduties, despite Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s claims to the contrary) was given a desk upstairs, as were  nother Caucasian employees who were not high-ranking. P1. SMF at HI 47. Moreover,  nPlaintiff testified that he used a computer to perform his paperwork. P1. SMF at HI 47.  nPlaintiff believes that Metzler  xe2  x80  x99 s way of acting and carrying himself indicated that he  nwas racist and that Metzler would have given a Caucasian person in Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s shoes  nthe benefit of the doubt. Def. SMF at HI 49.  n  nFurthermore, Plaintiff believes that Stratas had an organized scheme to reduce  nthe number of African-American employees at the Valdosta Plant. Def. SMF at HI 50.  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s reason for believing this is that he   xe2  x80  x9cjust   xe2  x80  x94 got to find the fault somewhere.  xe2  x80  x9d  nDef. SMF at HI 50. Since November 1, 2014, Stratas has lost, voluntarily and  ninvoluntarily, a total of twenty-one (21) employees from the Valdosta Plant. Def. SMF  nat HI 51. Twelve of those individuals were African-American. Def. SMF at HI 51.  nDuring the same time period, Stratas has hired thirty-four (34) new employees at the  n  nValdosta Plant, and twenty-five (25) 0fth0seindividua1s are African-American.5 Def.  n  nSMF at  xe2  x80  x98][51.  n  n5Defendant cites Exhibit C, HI 17 for this proposition, but, in fact, as Plaintiff  npoints out, there actually is no Exhibit C, HI 17 (this fact is in Exhibit B, HI 17).  nRegardless, the Court upholds Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s obj ection here.  n  n12Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 13 of 35  n  nII. DISCUSSION  n  nA. Summary J udgment Standard  n  nSummary judgment is authorized When   xe2  x80  x9cthe pleadings, the discovery and  ndisclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as  nto any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  xe2  x80  x9d  nFed. R. CiV. P. 56(0). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of  ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes  nv. S. H. Kress & C0., 398 U.S. 144, 175 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724  nF.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court  nthat there is   xe2  x80  x9can absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party  xe2  x80  x99 s case.  xe2  x80  x9d Celotex  nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). In making its determination, the court  nmust View the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the  nnonmoving party.  n  nOnce the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving  nparty must come forward With specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a  ngenuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S.  n574, 587 (1986). The nonmoving party is required   xe2  x80  x9cto go beyond the pleadings  xe2  x80  x9d and  nto present competent evidence designating   xe2  x80  x9cspecific facts showing that there is a  n  ngenuine issue for trial.  xe2  x80  x9d Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally,   xe2  x80  x9c[t]he mere existence of  n  n13Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 14 of 35  n  na scintilla of evidence  xe2  x80  x9d supporting the nonmoving party  xe2  x80  x99 s case is insufficient to defeat  na motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252  n(1986).  n  nWhen considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make  ndecisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249;  nRyder Int  xe2  x80  x99l Corp. v. F irstAmerican Nat  xe2  x80  x99l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991).  nRather, the court only determines Whether there are genuine issues of material fact to  nbe tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those  nthat are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or  naffect the outcome of a suit Will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.  nId.  n  nIf a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness  nof the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by  nevidence, or if it is created by evidence that is   xe2  x80  x9cmerely colorable  xe2  x80  x9d or is   xe2  x80  x9cnot  nsignificantly probative.  xe2  x80  x9d Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine   xe2  x80  x9cif the evidence is such that  na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  xe2  x80  x9d Id. at 242.  nMoreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record.  nMatsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party   xe2  x80  x9cmust do more than simply show  n  nthat there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.  xe2  x80  x9d Id. at 586.   xe2  x80  x9cWhere the  n  n14Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 15 of 35  n  nrecord taken as a Whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-  nmoving party, there is no   xe2  x80  x98genuine issue for trial.  xe2  x80  x9d  xe2  x80  x99 Id. at 587 (quoting F irst Nat  xe2  x80  x99l  nBank ofArizona v. Cities Service C0., 391 U.S. 253, 289 (1968)). Thus, the standard  nfor summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict:   xe2  x80  x9cWhether the evidence  npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or Whether it is so  none-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of 1aw.  xe2  x80  x9dAnders0n, 477 U.S. at 259.  n  nB. Plaintijf  xe2  x80  x99s Title VII Race Discrimination Claim  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s only remaining claim is for race discrimination under Title VII of the  nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Which provides that it is unlawful for an employer   xe2  x80  x9cto  ndiscriminate against any individual With respect to his compensation, terms,  nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual  xe2  x80  x99s race, color,  nreligion, seX, or national origin.  xe2  x80  x9d 42 U.S.C.   xc2  xa7 2000e-2(a)(1). T0 prevail on a Title VII  nclaim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted With discriminatory intent.  nHawkins v. Ceco Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 980  xe2  x80  x94981 (11th Cir. 1989); Clark v. Huntsville  nCity Bd. ofEduc. , 717 F.2d 525, 529 (11th Cir. 1983). Such discriminatory intent may  nbe established either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence meeting the  nfour-pronged test set out for Title VII cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,  n411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1561  xe2  x80  x9462 (11th Cir. 1997);  n  nNix v.

Under this framework, a plaintiff is first required  nto create an inference of discriminatory intent, and thus carries the initial burden of  nestablishing a prima facie case of discrimination.

Once  nthe plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant must   xe2  x80  x9carticulate some  nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason  xe2  x80  x9d for the adverse employment action. M cDonnell  nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Jones, 137 F.3d at 1310. This burden is   xe2  x80  x9cexceedingly light  xe2  x80  x9d  nin comparison to the burden required if the plaintiff has presented direct evidence of  n  ndiscrimination. Smith v. Homer, 839 F.2d 1530, 1537 (11th Cir. 1988). If the  n  ndefendant is able to carry this burden and explain its rationale, the plaintiff, in order  n  n17Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 18 of 35  n  nto prevail, must then show that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for  ndiscrimination.

C0.,  n698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983).  n  nA plaintiff is entitled to survive a defendant  xe2  x80  x99s motion for summary judgment  nif there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of  nmaterial fact regarding the truth of the employer  xe2  x80  x99s proffered reasons for its actions.  nCombs, 106 F.3d at 1529. A primafacie case along With sufficient evidence to reject  nthe employer  xe2  x80  x99s explanation is all that is needed to permit a finding of intentional  ndiscrimination. Reeves v.

Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate  nthe evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of  ndiscrimination.  xe2  x80  x9d United States Postal Serv.

The Eleventh Circuit has held that this framework of shifting burdens of proof  nis a valuable tool for analyzing evidence in cases involving alleged disparate  n  ntreatment, but the framework is only a tool. Nix v. WLC Y Radio/Rahall Comm, 738  n  n18Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 19 of 35  n  nF.2d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir. 1984). The   xe2  x80  x9cultimate question  xe2  x80  x9d is not Whether a plaintiff  nhas established a prima facie case or demonstrated pretext, but   xe2  x80  x9cWhether the defendant  nintentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.  xe2  x80  x9d Id., 738 F.2d at 1184 (quoting  nAikens, 460 U.S. at 713- 14); see also Jones, 137 F.3d at 1313. The plaintiff retains the  nultimate burden of proving that the defendant is guilty of intentional discrimination.  nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  n  nIn the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant discriminated  nagainst him on the basis of his race (African-American) in Violation of Title VII.  nSpecifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s decision to terminate Plaintiff was  n  xe2  x80  x9cintentional and based solely on Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s desire to minimize the amount of  nAfrican Americans Who were employed at Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s South Georgia plant.  xe2  x80  x9d Am.  nCompl. [12] at HI 27. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s purported reason  nfor his termination is merely pretextual. Am. Compl. at HI 28. Plaintiff does not  ncontend that he has produced any direct evidence of any discriminatory intent, and the  nundersigned finds that he has not done so. Thus, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s claim of race  ndiscrimination rests purely on circumstantial evidence and must be analyzed under the  n  nMcDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework.  n  n19Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 20 of 35  n  n1. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Prima Facie Case  n  nUnder the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework, a plaintiff can generally  nestablish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under Title VII by showing  nthat: 1) he is a member of a protected class;6 2) he was subjected to an adverse  nemployment action by his employer; 3) he was qualified to do the job in question; and  n4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his protected  nclassification (i.e., those of a different seX, race, or religion) more favorably than it  ntreated him. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 US. at 802; see also Wright v. Southland  nCorp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir. 1999); Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562  n(11th Cir. 1997). The Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff is a member of a  nprotected class and he was qualified to do the job in question. Defendant contends,  nhowever, that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of race discrimination  nbecause he has failed to present evidence showing that Stratas treated anyone outside  n  nhis protected class more favorably than it treated him. The Court agrees.  n  n6 Although courts continue to include the requirement that a plaintiff establish  nas part of a prima facie case that he or she is a member of a   xe2  x80  x9cprotected class,  xe2  x80  x9d it is  nclear that individuals of any seX, race, or religion may pursue claims of employment  ndiscrimination under Title VII. See Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1290  nn.3 (11th Cir. 1999) (Citing McDonald v. Santa F e Trail Transp. C0., 427 US. 273,  n278-80 (1976)). Thus, the key element of the prima facie case is establishing that  npersons outside of the plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s protected classification (i.e., those of a different seX,  nrace, or religion) were treated more favorably by the employer.

See Cuddeback v. F lorida Bd. 0fEduc., 381 F.3d 1230,  n1235 (11th Cir. 2004); Hawkins v. Ceca Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 982 (11th Cir. 1989);  nsee also McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 US. at 802. In this case, however, Plaintiff  nmakes no allegations that a person outside of his protected class was hired to replace  nhim.  n  nWhen a plaintiff is unable to show that he was replaced by someone outside his  nprotected class, he may also establish a primafacie case of discrimination under Title  nVII by showing that his employer treated a similarly situated person outside his  nprotected class more favorably than it treated him under similar circumstances. See  nHolifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Knight v. Baptist  nHosp. ofMiami, 330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 2003); Silvera v. Orange Cnty.

Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to  nestablish a primafacie case of race discrimination based on his discharge because he  nhas failed to present any evidence that there eXists a similarly situated employee at all,  n  nlet alone one who was treated more favorably than he was.  n  n21Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 22 of 35  n  n  xe2  x80  x9cWhen evaluating an allegation of disparate treatment,  xe2  x80  x9d courts   xe2  x80  x9crequire that a  ncomparator be similarly-situated to the plaintiff in all relevant respects.  xe2  x80  x9d Stone &  nWebster Constr. v. United States Dep  xe2  x80  x99t of Labor, 684 F.3d 1127, 1135 (11th Cir.  n2012) (quotations and citation omitted).

B/E Aerospace, Inc. , 376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th  nCir. 2004).   xe2  x80  x9cEven if a plaintiff and comparator are similar in some respects,  ndifferences in their overall record may render them not   xe2  x80  x98similarly situated  xe2  x80  x99 for  npurposes of establishing a prima facie case.  xe2  x80  x9d Brown v. Jacobs Eng  xe2  x80  x99g, Inc., 401 F.  nApp  xe2  x80  x99X 478, 480 (11th Cir. 2010). Courts also consider whether the plaintiff and the  nproffered comparator were employed for similar periods.

In fact, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s only mention of a comparator is   xe2  x80  x9chis former supervisor, who,  ncoincidentally, was also African-American and was also terminated.  xe2  x80  x9d Pl. Br. [40] at 6.  n  nPlaintiff goes on to claim that   xe2  x80  x9cDefendant has presented no evidence that any white  n  n22Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 23 of 35  n  nemployees   xe2  x80  x94 even those who were assisting Plaintiff in his alleged crimes against the  ncompany   xe2  x80  x94 were terminated.  xe2  x80  x9d Id. It is Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s burden, however, to prove his claims,  nand specifically to demonstrate there is evidence of material fact to establish a prima  nfacie case of discrimination. Notably, Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence that any  nCaucasian employees, or, indeed, any other employees at all other than Breeden,  nviolated the Employee Purchase Program.  n  nPlaintiff makes other conclusory allegations, claiming that   xe2  x80  x9c[t]he disparity  nbetween the treatment of white employees and the African-American employees who  nwere terminated is clear  xe2  x80  x9d and   xe2  x80  x9c[t]here is no question that the actions of the recently-  nhired Caucasian plant manager treated any non-African-American in a similar  nfashion.  xe2  x80  x9d Id. In addition, Plaintiff argues that   xe2  x80  x9call the evidence before this Court  nindicates that Defendant restructured its management and proceed to systematically  neliminate long-term African-American employees at an astonishing rate.  xe2  x80  x9d Id. But  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s general allegations cite to no record evidence and are wholly unsupported  nby the facts outlined above.  n  nMoreover, to the extent that Plaintiff relies on the allegation that there were  nwhite employees selling oil to Plaintiff, and that these white employees were not  nterminated, Plaintiff neither cites to record evidence to support this contention nor  n  naddresses the proper question  xe2  x80  x94 whether there were white employees who were  n  n23Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 24 of 35  n  nengaged in storing oil on Stratas  xe2  x80  x99s premises who were not terminated. In addition,  neven if Plaintiff were addressing the proper issue, there is nothing to indicate from  nwhom Plaintiff purchased oil in excess of the four jugs he was allowed to purchase  nfrom Stratas per pay period. Without any citations to evidence to support these  nallegations, it is simply impossible for the Court to determine whether the Plaintiff has  npresented sufficient evidence to establish that there were other employees who were  nsimilarly situated to the Plaintiff in all relevant respects and committed similar  ninfractions, but were treated differently. For these reasons, the Court finds that  nPlaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence that Defendant treated a similarly  nsituated Caucasian employee more favorably than it treated Plaintiff.  n  nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient  nevidence to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination under Title VII and  nDefendant is entitled to summary judgment. Even assuming that he had done so,  nhowever, the Court finds that Defendant has presented a legitimate reason for the  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s termination, and Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of  npretext.  n  n2. Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Legitimate Reason  nThe Court finds that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it had a  n  nlegitimate reason for the Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s termination that was not based on his race. The  n  n24Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 25 of 35  n  ndetails surrounding the Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s termination are set forth in detail above. In sum,  nDefendant contends that it terminated Plaintiff because he was   xe2  x80  x9cstaging  xe2  x80  x9d the oil he  npurchased outside the Shipping Department, in Violation of the express instruction set  nforth on the Order Form for purchases under the Employee Purchase Program. Def.  nSMF   xe2  x80  x98][  xe2  x80  x98][ 18-19. Because Defendant required employees to remove oil right away after  npurchasing it through the Employee Purchase Program in order to keep track of its  ninventory, and Plaintiff repeatedly violated the instruction, Defendant terminated  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s employment.  n  nIt is undisputed that since November 21, 2011, the Valdosta Plant had an  nEmployee Purchase Program in place under Which employees could purchase oil from  nStratas for their personal use. Def. SMF at HI 14. Through the Employee Purchase  nProgram, oil was made available to employees of Stratas at a lower price than that  nWhich Stratas charged its customers. Def. SMF at HI 15. Thus, there was a limit on the  namount of oil employees could purchase  xe2  x80  x94 a maximum of two jugs of each of two  nkinds of oil, i.e., four jugs of oil per pay period. Def. SMF at   xe2  x80  x98][  xe2  x80  x98][ 16-17. As part of the  nEmployee Purchase Program, employees had to fill out an Order Form and pick up  ntheir orders from the Shipping Department at specified times. Def. SMF at HI 18. When  nan employee picks up his order, he is supposed to promptly take it to his vehicle and  n  nemployees are not allowed to store their oil sales outside of the shipping office or in  n  n25Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 26 of 35  n  nthe warehouse according to the terms of the Order Form. Def. SMF at HI 19. This  nrequirement is in place to ensure that Stratas can properly account for and track all  njugs of oil leaving the warehouse. Def. SMF at HI 20.  n  nIt is also undisputed that Plaintiff regularly purchased his full allotment of oil  nunder the Employee Purchase Program and regularly purchased additional jugs of oil  nfrom other employees Who purchased their full allotments. Def. SMF at HI 21. Though  nPlaintiff was allowed to park inside, it was still sometimes difficult for him to load the  npurchased oil into his vehicle right away. Def. SMF at M 23-24. Thus, Plaintiff claims  nthat his direct supervisor, Breeden, told him that he could stage his oil by the Shipping  nDepartment. Def. SMF at HI 24.  n  nOn May 22, 2014, Simmons, the Plant Manager at the time, received a report  nfrom a   xe2  x80  x9creliable Witness  xe2  x80  x9d that he or she had observed Plaintiff stealing jugs of oil from  nStratas. Def. SMF at HI 25. Specifically, the Witness saw Plaintiff taking jugs of oil out  nan open fire door and toward Breeden  xe2  x80  x99 s car. Def. SMF at HI 26. Before speaking With  nPlaintiff, Simmons independently verified that there had been no employee purchases  nof oil on the date of the alleged theft, so there should not have been any cases of oil  nleaving the facility aside from   xe2  x80  x9cnormal orders.  xe2  x80  x9d Def.

Def. SMF at HI 29. Metzler, after he began to investigate, learned that  nBreeden had called one or two people who he believed might have reported him to  nmanagement for the alleged theft of oil. Def. SMF at HI 30. Metzler contacted  nCorporate Security to investigate the situation further, and on August 5, 2015, two  ninvestigators met Breeden and Plaintiff at the Valdosta Plant. Def. SMF at   xe2  x80  x98][  xe2  x80  x98][ 30-31.  nPlaintiff and Breeden were questioned separately, and Plaintiff denied that he was  naware of any theft but admitted that he had been purchasing additional oil beyond his  nallotment from his fellow employees. Def. SMF at   xe2  x80  x98][  xe2  x80  x98][ 31-32. Plaintiff also told the  ninvestigators that he had been storing oil on the premises of the Valdosta Plant, rather  nthan removing the oil right away. Def. SMF at HI 32. Thereafter, Plaintiff was  nsuspended then terminated because he had violated the Employee Purchase Program  nby storing the oil he purchased on Stratas  xe2  x80  x99s premises instead of removing it  nimmediately. Def. SMF at HI 33.  n  nIn sum, the Court finds that the Defendant has met the burden of presenting  nsufficient evidence that it had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s employment. Thus, in order for Plaintiff to defeat the Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s Motion  n  nfor Summary J udgment, he must cite to competent evidence in the record that would  n  n27Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 28 of 35  n  nbe sufficient to establish that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s proffered reason is a pretext for  ndiscrimination.  n3. Pretext  n  nA plaintiff may carry the burden of showing that the employer  xe2  x80  x99s proffered  nreasons are pretextual by showing that they have no basis in fact, that they were not  nthe true factors motivating the decision, or that the stated reasons were insufficient to  nmotivate the decision. A plaintiff can either directly persuade the court that a  ndiscriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or show indirectly that the  nemployer  xe2  x80  x99s ultimate justification is not believable.

In other words, the plaintiff has the opportunity to come  nforward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the  nprima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the  nreasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment  ndecision.

Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011),  nPlaintiff attempts to use the case to skirt over the fact that he cannot show that a  n  nsimilarly situated individual outside the protected class was treated more favorably  n  n29Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 30 of 35  n  nthan he was and declares that   xe2  x80  x9cit is clear that a genuine issue of material fact exists.  xe2  x80  x9d  nP1. Br. at 7.  n  nIn Smith, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the plaintiff did not need to rely  non the McDonnell Douglas presumption because   xe2  x80  x9cthe record contained sufficient  nevidence to allow a jury to infer that [Defendant] Lockheed fired [Plaintiff] Mitten  nbecause he is white.  xe2  x80  x9d Smith, 644 F.3d at 1328. Although the plaintiff had failed to  nshow that he was disciplined less favorably under a zero tolerance policy than a  nsimilarly situated black employee, the plaintiff had shown that there were  npreferentially treated black employees in non-supervisory positions. Id. at 1326. In  naddition, Plaintiff had set forth evidence that yielded the inference of race  ndiscrimination, including that Lockheed   xe2  x80  x9chad a substantial incentive to discipline  nwhite employees more harshly than black employees  xe2  x80  x9d because it had received bad  npublicity and that   xe2  x80  x9cLockheed consciously injected race considerations into its  ndiscipline decision making without an adequate explanation for doing so  xe2  x80  x9d when it  nused a   xe2  x80  x9cmatrix  xe2  x80  x9d that included race in making disciplinary decisions. Id. at 1341. Thus,  neven though the plaintiff could not meet the fourth prong 0f the McDonnell Douglas  nframework, the Eleventh Circuit found that there was sufficient circumstantial  nevidence in the record to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  n  ntermination was because of his race. That is, though deeming a person similarly  n  n30Case 1:16-cv-00081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 4 of 35  n  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s objections to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Statement of Material Facts are almost  nexclusively premised on Local Rule 56.1B(1)(a), that is, that the citation to the record  nDefendant puts forth does not support Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s factual allegation. However,  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s objections concerning Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s citations to the record are overruled.  nDefendant attached three exhibits to its Motion for Summary J udgment, and though  nits references to the page numbers Within the exhibits cite to the original page numbers  nof Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s deposition and the other documents, rather than to the page number  nentered in the Court  xe2  x80  x99s filing system, Defendant properly cites support for its factual  nallegations.2  n  nPlaintiff also substantively disputes some of Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s proffered facts, but  nthe maj ority of these disputes are over minor and immaterial is sues.3 Accordingly, the  nCourt Will not rule on each and every objection or dispute presented by the parties,  nand Will discuss those objections and disputes in the analysis section only When  nnecessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact. Finally, the  nCourt notes that Plaintiff misnumbers his obj ections as to Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s Statement of  nMaterial Facts beginning at Paragraphs 21 and 22. Thus, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s responses to  n  nDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s Statement of Material Facts diverge at Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Paragraph 22 (which  n  n2In referencing Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s deposition, Which is Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s Exhibit A, the Court  nadopts Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s method of citation.  n  n3Moreover, few of Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s responses actually cite to any record evidence.  n  n4Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 31 of 35  n  nsituated may require that the person occupy the same position as the plaintiff, that is  nnot the exclusive means by Which to document evidence of racial discrimination.  n  nThus, While it is true that the McDonnell Douglas framework is not meant to  nbe applied rigidly, and a plaintiff may raise a reasonable inference of an employer  xe2  x80  x99s  ndiscriminatory intent through various forms of circumstantial evidence, see Smith, 644  nF.3d at 1328, there must be evidence from Which a factfinder could infer intentional  ndiscrimination by the decisionmaker. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s allegation, however, is nothing more  nthan a conclusory statement that is unsupported by any evidence in the record and his  nreliance on Smith is unfounded.  n  nMoreover, Plaintiff suggests that because Defendant does not contest that  nPlaintiff is a member of a protected class, was terminated, and had the ability to do the  njob, there is automatically a genuine is sue of material fact such that summary  njudgment is unwarranted. See id. (  xe2  x80  x9cThat Defendant concedes the fact that three out of  nfour tests have been decided in Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s favor makes it clear that summary judgment  nis wholly inappropriate in this matter.  xe2  x80  x9d). This is an incorrect interpretation of the  nshowing required by a plaintiff to put forth a primafacie case of race discrimination,  nand a Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s burden to show pretext is a heavier one than to set forth a primafacie  ncase. Reliance on Smith for purposes of this argument is, as explained above,  n  ninapposite.  n  n31Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 32 of 35  n  nPlaintiff has provided no evidence to support his allegations. Indeed, even  nPlaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s testimony does not indicate that Metzler was motivated in any way by race.  nPlaintiff testified that Metzler refused to speak to all people who worked on the   xef  xac  x82oor  nof the Plant  xe2  x80  x94 whether African-American or Caucasian. He also testified that the people  nwho worked upstairs, in offices near Metzler and away from the Plant   xef  xac  x82oor, were both  nCaucasian and African-American. Plaintiff testified that one Caucasian employee,  nwho was a   xe2  x80  x9cleadman,  xe2  x80  x9d like Plaintiff, also had a desk upstairs. Def. EX. A at 211-14.  nHowever, there is no evidence that the Caucasian employee engaged in similar  nconduct to Plaintiff, i.e., staged oil on Stratas  xe2  x80  x99s premises, or that his duties were  nsimilar to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s because he was not a part of the Packaging Department. This  nalone, then, is not evidence of any kind of pervasive atmosphere of race  ndiscrimination. Though Plaintiff believes that Metzler was motivated by race, he has  nproffered no evidence that supports these allegations at all.  n  nThe bottom line is that Plaintiff has provided no record support for his beliefs,  nand the Court cannot sit in judgment of an employer  xe2  x80  x99 s decision, absent evidence that  na discriminatory motive was the underlying basis. As the Eleventh Circuit has  nexplained:  n  nTitle VII does not take away an employer  xe2  x80  x99 s right to interpret its rules as  n  nit chooses, and to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules.  n  nTitle VII addresses discrimination. . . . Title VII is not a shield against  nharsh treatment at the workplace. Nor does the statute require the  n  n32Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 33 of 35  n  nemployer to have good cause for its decisions. The employer may fire an  nemployee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based an erroneous  nfacts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a  ndiscriminatory reason. While an employer  xe2  x80  x99 s judgment or course of action  nmay seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question is simply  nWhether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. The  nemployer  xe2  x80  x99 s stated legitimate reason . . . does not have to be a reason that  nthe judge or jurors would act on or approve.  n  nNix v.

See Jackson  n  nv. Cal-Westem Packaging Corp., 602 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 2010) (finding that a  n  n33Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 34 of 35  n  nplaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s   xe2  x80  x9cself  xe2  x80  x94serving statements  xe2  x80  x9d that denied any wrongdoing were insufficient to  ncreate a triable issue of fact with regard to his age discrimination claim because   xe2  x80  x9cthe  nissue is not the truth or falsity of the allegation  xe2  x80  x9d of wrongdoing, but only   xe2  x80  x9cwhether the  nemployer reasonably believed the . . . allegation and acted on it in good faith  xe2  x80  x9d). Even  nassuming that Plaintiff believed he had the right to stage his oil on Stratas  xe2  x80  x99 s premises,  nthat would not in itself show that Metzler knew about this supposed permission, or  nthat his decision to strictly enforce the policy was the result of discrimination. Even  nif Metzler made a harsh or unfair decision, there is no evidence of pretext.7  n  nUpon a review of the evidence in the record, the Court finds that Plaintiff has  nfailed to present any evidence that the Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s proffered reasons for terminating  nhis employment was a pretext for race discrimination. Accordingly, the undersigned  nRECOMMENDS that Defendant  xe2  x80  x99 s Motion for Summary J udgment [37] be  n  nGRANTED and that Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s sole remaining claim be DISMISSED.  n  n7 Similarly, Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99 s reference to the fact that he   xe2  x80  x9cwas purchasing additional  noil from other employees . . . not to further his own personal gain, but to assist his  nmotorcycle club in raising money for the less fortunate,  xe2  x80  x9d Pl. Br. at 7-8, is immaterial.  nThere is no evidence that Metzler was aware of these supposed charitable motives.  nMetzler also did not decide to terminate Plaintiff on grounds related to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  nexcess purchases, but on Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s decision to stage oil on Stratas  xe2  x80  x99s premises in  nViolation of the Employee Purchase Program. Most basically, that an employee  nbelieves he has good or mitigating reasons to Violate a company policy does not itself  nprove pretext when the employer decides to enforce the policy anyway.  n  n34Case 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 35 of 35  n  nIII.

Def. SMF at   xe2  x80  x98][  xe2  x80  x98][ 14-15. To  nensure that employees do not undercut Stratas  xe2  x80  x99 s business by buying oil and re-selling  nit to customers at a lower price than Stratas itself offers, employees are limited to  n  npurchasing a maximum of two jugs each of two kinds of oil (clear fry and peanut oil)  n  nthat Stratas processes and packages.

Plaintiff  nreceived her right to sue on December 14, 2015, and this Complaint is filed Within 90  n  ndays of her receipt of such notice.  n  nFACTS  n  n   n  n9.  nBolton began her most recent stint of employment with IBM in J uly 1985.  n10.  nShe became the Platform Leader in the System Technology Group of IBM  n  nInside Sales North America (STG) approximately seven years ago.  n  n1 1.  nIn that position Bolton repeatedly received one of the highest possible ratings  n  non her annual performance evaluation.Case 1:16-cv-00113-SCJ Document 1 Filed 01/13/16 Page 4 of 10  n  n12.  nFor as long as Bolton served as a Platform Leader, she was the only woman on  nthe executive group for the inside sales power/storage team.  n1 3.  nHowever, she did not occupy an executive position, and was the only member  nof the team that did not.  n14.  nIn August 2013, Eric Menaker became the new supervisor assigned to Bolton  xe2  x80  x99s  nteam.  n15.  nWithin six months of his arrival Bolton received the lowest rating she ever  nreceived and he removed her from the executive track.  n16.  nHe repeatedly referred to Bolton as a   xe2  x80  x9cpit bull  xe2  x80  x9d or   xe2  x80  x9cbull dog  xe2  x80  x9d and did not call  nany of her male team members such names.  n17.  nIn group meetings, Menaker ignored Bolton and never sought her input even  n  nthough he typically sought input from her male counterparts.Case 1:16-cv-00113-SCJ Document 1 Filed 01/13/16 Page 5 of 10  n  n1 8.  n  nIn December 2013, Bolton complained to the Human Resources Partner, Alicia  nKing, about Menaker  xe2  x80  x99s treatment and mentioned her belief that his treatment was due  nto Bolton  xe2  x80  x99s gender.  n  n19.  n  nJust two months later, in February 2014, Menaker informed Bolton that her  nposition title and payment structure were going to change. At that time she was cast  noff of his team.  n  n20.  n  nPrior to the reduction in Bolton  xe2  x80  x99s salary, she notified the Vice President of IBM  n  nInside Sales about Menaker  xe2  x80  x99s actions.  n21.  nNevertheless, in March or April 2014, the Changes took effect and Bolton  xe2  x80  x99s  n  ncompensation package was drastically reduced.  n  nw  nTitle VII   xe2  x80  x94 Gender Discrimination  n  n22.  n  nA11 preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.Case 1:16-cv-00113-SCJ Document 1 Filed 01/13/16 Page 6 of 10  n  n23.  n  nDefendant discriminated against Plaintiff because of her gender treating her less  n  nfavorably than her male co-workers in regards to title and compensation.  n  n24.  n  nDefendant continued to discriminate against Plaintiff because of her gender in  n  npromotional opportunities and assignment of duties.  n25.  n  nThe ongoing gender discrimination to which Plaintiff is subjected by  nDefendant is discriminatory and in Violation of Title VII, thus entitling her to all  nappropriate relief provided under the statute.  n  n26.  n  nDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s actions were willful, deliberate, and intended to cause Plaintiff  nharm and/or were committed with reckless disregard of the harm caused to Plaintiffs,  nand were in derogation of her federally protected rights.  n  n27.  nAs a result of Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered lost wages and  n  nbenefits and has suffered mental and emotional distress.Case 1:16-cv-00113-SCJ Document 1 Filed 01/13/16 Page 7 of 10  n  n28.  nPlaintiff was damaged by Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s actions in an amount to be proven at  ntrial.  n29.  n  nPlaintiff is entitled to the relief set forth in the prayer for relief below.  n  nw  nTitle VII   xe2  x80  x94 Retaliation  n  n30.  nA11 preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  n31.  n  nDefendant retaliated against Plaintiff for her complaint that her supervisor  nengaged in illegal discrimination based on her gender in Violation of Title VII by  ncontinuing to deprive her of promotional opportunities, opportunities for  ncompensation by demoting her and by changing her j 0b assignments.  n  n32.  nThe ongoing retaliation to Which Plaintiff is subjected by Defendant violates  n  nTitle VII, thus entitling her to all appropriate relieve provided under the statute.Case 1:16-cv-00113-SCJ Document 1 Filed 01/13/16 Page 8 of 10  n  n33.  n  nDefendant  xe2  x80  x99s actions were willful, deliberate and intended to cause Plaintiff  nharm and/or were committed with reckless disregard of the harm caused to Plaintiff,  nand were in derogation of her federally protected rights.  n  n34.  n  nAs a result of Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered lost wages and  n  nbenefits and has suffered mental and emotional distress.  n  n35.  n  nPlaintiff was damaged by Defendant  xe2  x80  x99s actions in an amount to be proven at  n  ntrial.  n36.  nPlaintiff is entitled to the relief set forth in the prayer for relief below.  nPRAYER FOR RELIEF  n  nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff demand a TRIAL BY J URY and that the following  nrelief be granted:  n  nA.

The Contract is Not Ambiguous  n  nUnder Georgia law, contract construction involves three steps: First, the  ntrial court must decide Whether the language is clear and unambiguous; if so, the  ncourt enforces the contract according to its clear terms, looking only to the  n  ncontract itself for guidance as to its meaning. E Stonegate Bank V. TD Bank,  n  nN.A., 596 F. App  xe2  x80  x99x 834, 835 (11th Cir. 2015).

If the  ncontract is ambiguous, the court must apply the rules of contract construction to  nresolve the ambiguity. Li. If the contract remains ambiguous after those rules are  napplied, the question of What the ambiguous language means and What the parties  nintended must be resolved by a jury. E Q.   xe2  x80  x9cThe purpose of contract  nconstruction is to effectuate the intent of the parties, and that intent is presumed to  nreside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.  xe2  x80  x9d ProfiTel Grp.,  nLLC V.

Because  n  nthe Contract can be read multiple ways, she contends, the Contract is ambiguous,  n  n12Case 1:16-cv-00187-TWT Document 34 Filed 07/18/16 Page 13 of 28  n  nand thus should be construed against Inalfa as the drafter, particularly given that  nthe Contract was a contract of adhesion.9  n  xe2  x80  x9cIt is a cardinal rule of contract construction that When the construction of a  n  ncontract is doubtful, the construction that goes most strongly against the drafter 0f  n  nthe agreement is to be preferred.  xe2  x80  x9d Winterboer V.

However,  nreading the Contract as Inalfa does shows that this result is not actually arbitrary.  nInstead, as plaintiff later observes, it leads to the result that only statutes that  ncontain administrative exhaustion requirements, such as Title VII, would not be  ncovered by the 180-day limitation.10 Plaintiff contends that if this was the result  nInalfa intended, it   xe2  x80  x9ccould have simply said so.  xe2  x80  x9d But the fact that Inalfa did not  ndoes not render the parties  xe2  x80  x99 agreement less binding or their intent less clear.  n  nFinally, Ms. Lilley  xe2  x80  x99s contention that this interpretation is   xe2  x80  x9cunnecessary  xe2  x80  x9d  nbecause the law already prohibits contractually shortening statutes of limitations  nthat affect administrative exhaustion requirements also fails.

Inalfa  xe2  x80  x99s language, While perhaps inartfully drafted, is not  nsuper  xef  xac  x82uous; instead, it excludes from the Contract  xe2  x80  x99s statute of limitations civil  nrights statutes that cannot legally be subject to such a limitation.

Ms. Lilley does not dispute that  nshe signed the Contract, that a representative from NGS walked her through it, or  nthat the 180-day limitations period in the Contract is reasonable. Plaintiff had an  nadequate opportunity to investigate her Claim and file suit Within the 180  xe2  x80  x94day  nperiod outlined in the Contract; all of the facts giving rise to her Claim occurred  n  nbefore her termination; and she filed a charge of discrimination With the EEOC 0n  n  nthe very day of her discharge.

Ms. Lilley was  nterminated on December 10, 2014. In order to timely bring her Section 1981  nretaliation claim, plaintiff was required to file suit by June 8, 2015.

As a result, her  nSection 1981 Claim is time-barred, and summary judgment should be granted in  ndefendant  xe2  x80  x99s favor.  n  nII.

(P1.  xe2  x80  x99s  nMot. 1.) Plaintiff states that the Title VII Claim could not have been brought  n  nearlier because, despite the fact that the EEOC issued a Notice of Right to Sue  n  n   n  nLetter (the   xe2  x80  x9cRTS Letter  xe2  x80  x9d) on March 5, 2015, (see Lilley Decl. [30  xe2  x80  x941] EX. F),  nneither she nor her attorney received it. (Li. at 2-4.) Ms. Lilley alleges that she  nnever received a copy because her address was listed incorrectly 0n the charge,  nand that her counsel never received a copy because the EEOC erroneously did not  n  nassociate him with her case, despite having communicated with him previously.  n  n17Case 1:16-cv-00187-TWT Document 34 Filed 07/18/16 Page 18 of 28  n  n(Li) Plaintiff thus contends that she could not have asserted this Claim earlier  neven With diligence, because she did not receive the RTS Letter due to  ncircumstances beyond her control. (Li. at 5-9.) Inalfa responds that plaintiff was  nnot diligent in pursuing her Title VII Claim and has not shown good cause for her  ndelay because she failed to contact the EEOC to inquire about the RTS Letter  nbefore the amendment deadline and failed to review the address listed on the  ncharge for accuracy. (Def.  xe2  x80  x99s Resp. [33] 3-6.) Defendant further argues that  namendment is futile, as plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Title VII claim is time  xe2  x80  x94barred for failure to file  nit within 90 days of receipt of the original RTS Letter. (Li. at 6-10.)  n  nA.

However, they disagree on the  napplication of the case-by-case approach here. Plaintiff states that the failure to  nreceive the RTS Letter was in no way her fault because,   xe2  x80  x9cdue to a series of  nadministrative errors by the EEOC, the RTS Notice was not issued to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s  ncounsel and was mailed without including Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s full address.  xe2  x80  x9d (Pl.  xe2  x80  x99s Mot. 2.)  nSpecifically, plaintiff asserts that she provided her full mailing address on the  nIntake Questionnaire she completed when filing the charge, but that the  n  ninvestigator failed to copy her apartment number onto the charge. (Li. at 3; see  n  n   n  nal  xef  xac  x82 Lilley Decl. Exs. A & B.) Although the EEOC Investigator told Ms. Lilley  nto review the   xe2  x80  x9cfacts  xe2  x80  x9d section of the form, which she did, he did not mention the  naddress section, so she did not review it. (Pl.  xe2  x80  x99s Mot. at 3.)  n  nPlaintiff further argues that the failure to receive the RTS Letter is in no  nway her fault because the letter was not sent to her counsel. Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s counsel  nsent a Letter of Representation t0 the EEOC on J anuary 20, 2015, requesting that  nthe EEOC send all future correspondence to him, which the EEOC acknowledged.  n  n(Pl.  xe2  x80  x99s Mot. at 3; see also Stark Decl.

Upon the Investigator  xe2  x80  x99s  n  n   n  nrequest, plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s counsel sent additional evidence on February 16, 2015, and  n  n22Case 1:16-cv-00187-TWT Document 34 Filed 07/18/16 Page 23 of 28  n  nassumed that, because he received no further communications, the EEOC had re  xe2  x80  x94  nopened the investigation. (P1.  xe2  x80  x99s Mot. 3-4.) The EEOC eventually issued the RTS  nLetter on March 5, 2015 (@ Lilley Decl. [30  xe2  x80  x941] EX.

(P1.  xe2  x80  x99s Mot. 4.) Thus, plaintiff and her counsel  ndid not receive the RTS Letter; they were made aware of it only after her counsel  ninquired about it on June 9, 2016. (Li)  n  nDefendant responds that plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Motion to Amend is untimely, because  nthe facts underlying her Title VII Claim are identical to those underlying her  nSection 1981 claim, so she was already aware of them at the time she filed the  nComplaint. (Def.  xe2  x80  x99s Resp. 4.) She has not shown good cause for delay, defendant  nargues, because had she exercised diligence in pursuing her claim, she would  nhave reviewed the address information on the charge form, sought confirmation  nfrom the EEOC that no notice of right to sue had been issued before the  n  nScheduling Order  xe2  x80  x99s deadline, or simply requested such a1etter within 180 days of  n  nthe filing of her charge pursuant to 29 CPR.   xc2  xa7 1601.28(a).

Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s Title VII retaliation  nClaim relies on the same facts underlying her Section 1981 claim. Thus, unless  nplaintiff can show that she did not receive the RTS Letter through no fault of her  nown, she cannot show good cause for failing to assert her Title VII claim earlier.  nPlaintiff has sufficiently alleged good cause for her delay. Neither she nor  nher counsel was aware that the EEOC had concluded its investigation of her  nclaim; in fact, counsel for plaintiff sent additional evidence at the EEOC  xe2  x80  x99s request,  nso it was reasonable for both to assume that the investigation was still underway.  nE Griffin V.

There was no reason  nplaintiff or her attorney should have been on notice that the RTS Letter had been  nissued and mailed when they reasonably believed the investigation was ongoing.  nAs Inalfa observes, Ms. Lilley must assume some responsibility for her  nclaim.   xe2  x80  x9cA plaintiff   xe2  x80  x98should not be heard to complain  xe2  x80  x99 unless the plaintiff has  n  nassumed the minimal   xe2  x80  x98burden of advising the EEOC of address changes or . . .  n  n24Case 1:16-cv-00187-TWT Document 34 Filed 07/18/16 Page 25 of 28  n  n[taken] other reasonable steps to ensure delivery of the notice to his current  n  n3  xe2  x80  x9d  n  naddress.

(Def.  xe2  x80  x99s Resp. 6-10.)

Because she did not do so, Inalfa contends, her Claim is  ntime-barred and cannot Withstand a motion to dismiss.  n  nAs discussed m Part III.B.1, however, plaintiff has shown that she did  nnot receive the RTS Letter due to circumstances beyond her control. Thus, the  npresumption of receipt of the original RTS Letter does not apply. Instead, the  ndate of actual receipt  xe2  x80  x94June 10, 2016  xe2  x80  x94triggers the 90-day period. Ms. Lilley  nfiled the Motion to Amend seeking to assert her Title VII claim on June 25, 2016,  nwell Within that period. Therefore, the Title VII retaliation Claim is timely, and  nallowing plaintiff to add it to the Complaint is not futile. Accordingly, the court  nGRANTS the Motion to Amend [30].  n  nIII.

As a result, the Retina Clinic was frequently under staffedCase 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400244-WSD Document 1 Filed 01/26/16 Page 5 of 14  n  nand Plaintiff was forced to complete additional work during her scheduled shifts and  nwork additional shifts on a weekly basis.  n16.  n  nAlthough Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s supervisor was aware that female technicians were  nfrequently missing work shifts in exchange for sexual favors, nothing was done to  ncorrect Dr. Halpern  xe2  x80  x99s behavior.  n  n17.  n  nDr. Halpern would often make vulgar sexually inappropriate comments to and  naround female technicians.  n  n18.  n  nDuring her employment Plaintiff witnessed Dr. Halpem have a sexual  nrelationship with at least two female technicians and inappropriately proposition  ndozens of female technicians for sex or to engage in a sexual relationship with him.  n  n19.  n  nAfter Plaintiff became engaged, Dr. Halpem began making inappropriate  ncomments to her about her relationship with her fiance (later husband) on a near  ndaily basis. For example, Dr. Halpern would tell Plaintiff that he could   xe2  x80  x9cprovide  nbetter for her.  xe2  x80  x9d Dr. Halpern would call Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s   xef  xac  x81ance her   xe2  x80  x9cbaby daddy,  xe2  x80  x9d would  ntell Plaintiff that she should have gotten   xe2  x80  x9cknocked up  xe2  x80  x9d by a doctor instead, and would  n  nsay that her   xef  xac  x81ance was a   xe2  x80  x9cdumb ass  xe2  x80  x9d and   xe2  x80  x9cgay.  xe2  x80  x9d Due to the age difference betweenCase 1:16-cv  xe2  x80  x9400244-WSD Document 1 Filed 01/26/16 Page 6 of 14  n  nPlaintiff and her husband, Dr. Halpern also told Plaintiff that her   xe2  x80  x9cbaby daddy  xe2  x80  x9d was  nmolesting her and that if she had daddy issues he could help her   xe2  x80  x9cget over that.  xe2  x80  x9d  n20.  n  nDr. Halpem and another female technician had a Violent physical altercation  nin the Retina Clinic hallway. This incident was reported to Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x9d s supervisor and  nresulted in the female technician  xe2  x80  x99s transfer. As a result, Dr. Halpem increased his  nsexual advances toward Plaintiff and the other remaining female technicians. For  nexample, Dr. Halpern would stroke Plaintiff  xe2  x80  x99s face and tell her that she would be  n  xe2  x80  x9cripe for plucking  xe2  x80  x9d in a few years.  n  n21.  n  nIn J anuary of 2015, Plaintiff told Dr. Halpem that the work environment was  nstressful and that the inappropriate sexual innuendos and demeaning comments  nabout her husband needed to stop.

As previously noted , Pittman Consultants provided additional equipment , a U-Haul nto transport equipment , transportation to and from the work site , and hotel lodging . Moreover , only Pittman Consultants could employ additional workers . As a result , this nfactor weighs in favor of employee status as well.47 Fourth , the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 jobs do not n nrequire special licenses or certifications .

More importantly , though , xe2 x80 x9cthe fact that workers are skilled is not itself indicative of nindependent contractor status . xe2 x80 x9d48 What matters is Whether the worker is exercising nbusiness skills or initiative in addition to his or her technical skills.49 There is nothing nin the record that indicates the Plaintiffs used their technical skills in an independent nway . They simply followed the Pittman Consultants xe2 x80 x99 and IBG Construction xe2 x80 x99 s schedule nand instructions . Fifth , the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 duties are clearly integral to Pittman Consultants . The Defendant is a general contractor for residential and commercial nconstruction proj ects . And , obviously , most construction proj ects need carpenters and npainters . Additionally , the Defendant Pittman acknowledged that IBG Construction nwould not have paid Pittman Consultants but for the Plaintiffs performing their nduties.50 n The only factor that supports an independent contractor status is duration .

An employee is xe2 x80 x9cengaged in ncommerce xe2 x80 x9d under the FLSA if he or she is : ndirectly participating in the actual movement of persons or things in ninterstate commerce by ( i ) working for an instrumentality of interstate ncommerce , e. g. , transportation or communication industry employees , or n ( ii ) by regularly using the instrumentalities of interstate commerce in his nwork , e.g. , regular and recurrent use of interstate telephone , telegraph , nmails , or travel.25 The question , therefore , is Whether the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 trip to Kentucky qualifies as n xe2 x80 x9cregular and recurrent use of interstate . . . travel . xe2 x80 x9d26 The Court finds that it does not . Traveling once to Kentucky to work on a construction proj ect is simply too isolated.27 The FLSA xe2 x80 x99s implementing regulation explains that the typical jobs that involve n nregular interstate travel include xe2 x80 x9ctraveling service men , traveling buyers , traveling n nconstruction crews , collectors , and employees of such organizations as circuses , n n25 Theme V.

So While the Plaintiffs are a construction crew that traveled to another state , the Court is not nconvinced that the regulation intended a single trip to be sufficient . Moreover , the Court xe2 x80 x94 through its own research xe2 x80 x94 was unable to locate a single case that found one nout-of-state trip to be sufficient . n In response , the Plaintiffs point to J osendis V. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs , n Inc . 29 There , the Eleventh Circuit stated that because the plaintiff xe2 x80 x9cdid not travel n n n nacross state lines as part of his work for Wall to Wall , he can not claim individual ncoverage based on any of the travel he completed . xe2 x80 x9d30 The Plaintiffs contend that the ninverse of the Eleventh Circuit xe2 x80 x99s statement must then be true . xe2 x80 x9c [ I ] f an employee ncrosses state lines as part of his work , he would be subject to individual coverage nunder the FLSA . xe2 x80 x9d31 But the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 blanket statement contradicts the FLSA xe2 x80 x99s nimplementing regulation .

The relevant case nlaw is in agreement With the regulation . Courts that have examined the issue have ndone so on a case-by-case basis . For example , in Bowrin V. Catholic Guardian My , the court found that the plaintiff employees Who traveled out of state weekly nor two to four times per month established individual coverage , but the plaintiff nemployees Who traveled out of state only twice in their three years of employment did nnot establish individual coverage.33 As a result , the Court disagrees With the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 ncontention that traveling across state lines automatically qualifies an employee for nindividual coverage . n The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 Motion for Partial Summary J udgment n nregarding the issue of individual coverage should be denied.34 Nevertheless , the Court n n32 29 C.F.R . xc2 xa7 776.12. n33 417 F.

Accordingly , this n nmatter is now before the Court . n II . Discussion n From approximately November 6 , 2014 to November 2 , 2015 Garmon nwas jointly employed by Corporate Defendants and their Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) , Seals [ Doc . 67 at 2 ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 2 ) ] . Corporate Defendants are in the business of distributing television ncontent , and make money by selling advertising space [ chleL at 3 n ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 4 ) ] . Defendants Tuff TV Media Group and Tuff TV Worldwide are subsidiaries of Defendant Seals Entertainment [ ; g ; at n2 ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 3 ) ] . Defendant Seals was CEO of all Corporate Defendants , controlling and directing all Corporate Defendants [ lg xc3 xa9 nat 3 ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 5 ) ] . n Garmon 's title was Coordinator of Programming and Promotions , a njob which included scheduling the TV programming Corporate Defendants ndistributed , updating company ' websites and Facebook pages , and nhandling administrative tasks [ LQL at 3-4 ( citing Doc . 40-3 xef xac x82 16 ) ] . Seals assigned Garmon 's job duties , controlled his performance , and nreviewed and approved Garmon 's work [ Doc . 40-2 xef xac x82 18 ( citing Doc . 40-3 n xef xac x82 18 ) ] . Seals also controlled Garmon xe2 x80 x99s hours [ lg ; xef xac x82 19 ( citing Doc . n40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 19 ) ] . Defendants paid Garmon an hourly wage [ Doc . 67 at 4 n ( citing Damages Hearing Garmon Testimony ( hereinafter xe2 x80 x9cGarmon Test . xe2 x80 x9d ) ) ] . Garmon did not manage , hire , or fire employees , and his n nincome did not vary based upon exercising managerial skill [ Doc . 40-2 n n3Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 4 of 8 n n xef xac x82 20 ( citing Doc . 40-3 xef xac x82 20 ) ] . Garmon xe2 x80 x99s job did not require xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x94and he ndid not have xe2 x80 x94-any specialized training or skills [ lg xc3 xa9 xef xac x82 21 ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 1 ] 21 ) ] . During his employment with Defendants , that nposition was Garmon 's sole employment and sole source of income LLQ ; n xef xac x82 22 ( citing Doc . 40-3 xef xac x82 22 ) ] . Throughout his employment , Garmon 's nonly office was a room in Defendant Seals ' residence [ Doc . 67 at 4 n ( citing Doc . 40-3 1 23 , Doc . 40-4 xef xac x82 4 ) ] . n During the first seven weeks of Garmon xe2 x80 x99s employment , through December 27 , 2014 , Garmon was paid a regular rate of $ 10.00 per hour n [ ; g ; ( citing Garmon Test. ) ] . From November 9 , 2014 to December 27 , n2014 Garmon worked approximately 46 hours per week [ lgA ( citing Garmon Test. ) ] . From December 28 , 2014 to the end of his employment , Garmon was paid a regular rate of $ 12.00 per hour [ ; g ; at 5 ( citing Garmon Test. ) ] . From December 28 , 2014 through March 28 , 2015 Garmon nworked approximately 60 hours per week for ten of those weeks , and napproximatelyr 46 hours per ' week . the remaining ' three xe2 x80 x98weeks [ ; g ; n ( citing Garmon Test. ) ] . From March 29 , 2015 through October 17 , 2015 Garmon worked a total of 247 overtime hours [ ; g ; ( citing Garmon TBst. ) ] . Defendants knew of and/or approved the overtime hours Garmon worked [ ; g ; at 6 ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 30 ) ] . At no time during Garmon xe2 x80 x99s employment did Defendants ever pay Garmon one-and a xe2 x80 x94half ntimes his regular pay rate for his overtime hours ; he only ever nearned his regular pay rate for overtime hours [ l xef xac x81L at 5 ( citing Garmon Test. ) ] . n In summary , Garmon is owed $ 3,000 in overtime pay . The Court nassesses an additional award of $ 3,000 in liquidated damages . n Turning to the other claims , the evidence shows that during the n none year period of Garmon 's employment Seals xe2 x80 x99 treatment of him was n n4Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 5 of 8 n nabusive and controlling to a pathological degree . Seals admits that nhe has an anger management problem for which he has sought treatment . Seals frequently screamed at Garmon , in whom he did not have much nconfidence and vented his anger by issuing commands and comments nwhich frequently were demeaning . The evidence depicted Garmon as an nemotionally fragile person who found it difficult to cope with Seals xe2 x80 x99 naggressive manner . Seals understood Garmon xe2 x80 x99s fragility . Seals xe2 x80 x99 nabuse of Garmon took the form of screaming at him , threatening him , ninsisting that Garmon participate in unwelcome sexual activity , and nmaking sexual jokes and comments at Garmon xe2 x80 x99s expense . Garmon was nafraid of Seals . n The Court accepts Seals xe2 x80 x99 testimony that his treatment of Garmon nwas not uniformly negative . Specifically , when Garmon threatened to ncommit suicide Seals called the United Way Suicide Hotline and nobtained counseling for Garmon . He also kept Garmon on as an nemployee although he felt Garmon xe2 x80 x99s performance was inadequate . He ntold Garmon he could take time off to look for a new job , if he nwanted to so do . On one evening , Seals was contacted by police nconcerning Garmon . Garmon had gone to meet another man for a xe2 x80 x9csexual nhookup xe2 x80 x9d ; the other man.was involved in illegal drugs and was arrested nat the scene by police . Garmon was not arrested ; Seals went to get Garmon and took him home . Garmon and Seals frequently went out to nlunch together ; Seals always paid the bill . n Garmon credibly testified that Seals required him.to participate nin some sexual activity despite his objection . He testified that n Seals required him to provide oral sex at least 15 times , purportedly nto relieve Seals xe2 x80 x99 stress and that Seals required him , three or four n ntimes , to shave xe2 x80 x9cevery inch xe2 x80 x9d of Seals xe2 x80 x99 body . The Court accepts n n5Case 1:15-cv-04394 xe2 x80 x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 6 of 8 n Garmon 's testimony that Seals threatened to tell Garmon 's grandfather nthat Garmon was gay if he did not provide oral sex to Seals . n In addition , the Court accepts other testimony by Garmon as nfollows . n Seals participated . in . numerous group texts with . other ' men naffiliated with the Corporate Defendants . Garmon was also included . These texts sometimes demeaned Garmon . For example , Seals texted nthat Garmon had xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 x98demon seed , ' xe2 x80 x9d wore diapers , was a xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 x98stud , xe2 x80 x99 '' and was n xe2 x80 x9c [ good at ] sliding xe2 x80 x98his sausage ' in xe2 x80 x9d [ Doc . 67 at 10 ( citing Doc . 40-3 n W 42 , Garmon Test. , Doc . 66-1 ) ] . Seals also sent the group a picture n nof someone 's naked buttocks , and texted xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 x98Andrew cries and asks nvendors to f**k him even harder xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d [ Id . at 10 xe2 x80 x9411 ( citing Doc . 40-3 W 42 , Garmon Test. , Doc . 66-1 ) ] . On or around June 4 , 2015 in n nanother group text with the same group , the CFO 's brother texted a npicture of movie theater seats that had penises sticking out of them ; Seals replied xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 x98Why is Andrew not seating [ sic . ] in one of those nchairs ? ' xe2 x80 x9d [ ; g ; at 11 ( citing Doc . 40-3 W 44 , Garmon Test. , Doc . 66 xe2 x80 x94 n1 ) ] . Another time , Seals texted Garmon a picture of a person 's bare nbuttocks with a pitchfork shoved through them and a message stating n xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 x98This is what I am going to do to you on Halloween ! ! ' xe2 x80 x9d [ lgA at 10 n ( citing Doc . 40-3 W 41 , Garmon Test. , Doc . 66 xe2 x80 x941 ) ] . n The evidence which is most influential in awarding damages is a nvideo recording made by Garmon without Seals ' knowledge on November 2 , 2015 . On that morning , Seals ( who was in the shower ) nreceived a cell phone call from a client who wanted to know what was nthe problem with the company 's land line . The client had been trying nto reach Seals through the company land line and evidently had been n ntold that the telephone number was not in service . Seals was n n6Case 1:15-cv-04394 xe2 x80 x94ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 7 of 8 n nembarrassed . He blamed the failure to pay the telephone bill on Garmon . Seals flew into a rage , essentially cornering Garmon in the nroom connecting to the shower . Seals continually barked out orders nto Garmon to get the telephone company on the line and get the line nreconnected . However , Garmon was terrified by Seals xe2 x80 x99 anger and nthreatening demeanor and was tongue xe2 x80 x94tied . All of the foregoing is ncaptured on the video . Seals dismisses the video as xe2 x80 x9ca setup , '' but Seals ' actions certainly are accurately captured . While Seals ntemporarily blocked the door to the room so that Garmon could not nleave , that only lasted a few minutes . Garmon worked at the office nfor the rest of that day . However , when he left that evening he nresolved not to and did not return . n During his employment Garmon had difficulty sleeping at night nbecause he was worried about what might happen at work the next day n [ Doc . 67 at 14 ( citing Doc . 40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 52 , Garmon Test. ) ] . At work , Garmon was stressed , never knowing what Seals might do next , and when Seals did act out , Garmon was humiliated [ ; g ; at 14-15 ( citing Doc . n40 xe2 x80 x943 xef xac x82 52 , Garmon Test. ) ] . Near the end of his employment , Garmon nwould go home crying at night [ Garmon Test. , Wagner Test. ] . Garmon nlost approximately 25 pounds during the one year term of his nemployment . .lg ; He became nervous and apprehensive . He has sought ntherapy . n In assessing damages , the Court considers that Garmon.could.have nleft his employment with Defendants long before he did ; certainly , nwithin four months of beginning work Garmon knew the score concerning nthe work environment . Garmon 's explanation that he could not leave nearlier because he was supporting his mother and sister is n nunconvincing . The Court does not reject his testimony that he sent n n7Case 1:15-cv-04394-ODE Document 68 Filed 05/18/17 Page 8 of 8 n nmoney to his mother and sister , but does question his assertion that nthis made it impossible for him to leave . He could have looked for nanother job . This has a big impact on awardable damages . n Leaving aside the FLSA claims , the damages award on Garmon xe2 x80 x99s nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress subsumes the ndamages awardable on all other claims ( battery , negligent hiring , nassault , false imprisonment ) .

This case is before the Court on Kindred xe2 x80 x99s motion for summary judgment non all claims . [ Doc . 36 . ] For the reasons discussed herein , I find that Willocks ncannot make out a prima facie case on any of her claims , and therefore RECOMMEND that Kindred xe2 x80 x99s motion be GRANTED . n1 . Procedural History and Willocks xe2 x80 x99s Complaint n The following summary of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s amended complaint is excerpted nfrom my previous report on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s motion to dismiss , With some nmodification . [ Doc . 32 . ] n The first count of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s amended complaint is brought under Title VII . [ Doc . 22 at 6 . ] Willocks alleges that she was in the following three nprotected classes : a Hispanic individual from Panama ; black ; and being from Panama and having an accent . [ Id . ] She alleges that Kindred discriminated nagainst her because of her race , color , and/or national origin in firing her , and that nits motivation in firing her was , in whole or in part , based on those three factors . n [ Id . at 7 . ] Willocks further alleges that Kindred retaliated against her for refusing nto participate in its scheme to systematically force older Hispanic employees to n nquit 0r retire .

[ Doc . 36-2 at 41 xe2 x80 x9442 . ] n Schmitt stated in a declaration that he , Carter , Harrilson , and Gibson came nto a joint conclusion to fire Willocks . [ Doc . 36-4 ] [ 14 . ] Gibson confirmed that nshe approved the termination of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s employment based on the information nprovided by Schmitt , Harrilson , and Carter . [ Doc . 36-5 ] [ 24 . ] Schmitt further nstated that the reasons for firing Willocks were the suspected falsification of ndocuments and the failure to follow Harrilson xe2 x80 x99s directive to give her the ndocumentation before giving it to the auditor . [ Doc . 36-4 ] [ 16 . ] Schmitt and Gibson also both stated that neither spoke with Hoffmann concerning Willocks or nthe issues related to her termination . [ Id . ] [ 20 ; Doc . 36-5 ] [ 30 . ] 4 n E . Facts Concerning Willocks xe2 x80 x99s Disability Claim n Willocks only alleges disability in the form for high blood pressure and ndiabetes . [ Doc . 36-8 ] [ 71 . ] Neither condition affected Willocks xe2 x80 x99s ability to nfunction on a daily basis or resulted in her being restricted in any work activity . n n [ Id .

HI 76 . ] Willocks testified that nshe came into work that day at noon , mentioned to someone that she had not neaten breakfast and had no lunch . [ Doc . 36-2 at 19 . ] She Viewed it as harassment nthat she was nevertheless required to retrieve documentation rather than getting a nlunch break . [ Id . ] Willocks admits that she did not complain to anyone about nbeing mistreated on account of her disability , and she admits that none of the npeople who decided to fire her were aware of Willocks having requested any naccommodation . [ Doc . 36-8 M 77-78 . ] Ill . Evidentiary Rulings n In its reply brief , Kindred objects wholesale t0 the consideration of two npieces of evidence submitted along with Willocks xe2 x80 x99s response to Kindred xe2 x80 x99s motion nfor summary judgment . [ See Doc . 39 at 4-8 . ] Specifically , it objects to Exhibit A nof Willocks xe2 x80 x99s declaration and Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s declaration . [ Id . ] Before addressing the n nmerits of the case , I will address each evidentiary objection in turn . n n5 The statement of material facts states that this date was in 2014 , but that nappears to be a typographical error . n n12Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 13 of 45 n A . Exhibit A to Willocks xe2 x80 x99s declaration is probative of none of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s arguments , and therefore will not be considered in nmy analysis of the summary judgment motion . n Exhibit A of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s declaration is a two-page printout detailing an nanonymous December 2011 phone call complaining of discrimination at Kindred . n [ Doc . 38-3 at 9-10 . ] The report details that an anonymous caller complained that ntwo employees xe2 x80 x94Jamila Blossomgame and Patricia Brown xe2 x80 x94were unprofessional nand were singling out older employees for firing . [ Id . at 9 . ] The caller also stated nthat those two employees were singling out Willocks for termination . [ Id . ] The ndocument also contains notes on the investigation into the complaints , npresumably by human resources , and each complaint was found to be nunsubstantiated . [ Id . at 9-10 . ] n Nothing on the face of the document makes clear who created the ndocument or what entity maintained the document . [ See Doc . 38-3 at 9-10 . ] Likewise , Willocks xe2 x80 x99s declaration does not purport to state anything about the ndocument xe2 x80 x99s creation or maintenance . [ See id . at 3-7 . ] The only reference to Exhibit A in Willocks xe2 x80 x99s declaration appears to be paragraph 15 , where Willocks n nrelies on the document to state that somebody filed a complaint with Kindred in n December 2011 regarding age discrimination . [ Id . HI 15 . ] n n13Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 14 of 45 n Kindred makes three arguments as to why Exhibit A should be stricken . Specifically , it argues that ( 1 ) the document is not authenticated ; ( 2 ) the document nwas not produced during discovery despite being responsive to discovery nrequests ; and ( 3 ) the exhibit is based , in large part , on inadmissible hearsay . [ Doc . n39 at 4 xe2 x80 x946 . ] n Based on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s response brief , she appears to be putting forth the nexhibit as evidence related to her retaliation claim . [ See Doc . 38 at 7 , 9 . ] She nargues that it is relevant that she was discriminated against shortly after the npurported age discrimination scheme was reported to the Kindred hotline , [ id . at n7 ] , and that the exhibit is relevant to show that Willocks opposed the purported nscheme , [ id . at 9 ] . n Even accepting the document as properly authenticated and otherwise nadmissible , it is not at all clear how the challenged exhibit could support any of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s contentions unless Willocks herself placed the phone call to Kindred xe2 x80 x99s nhotline and that someone at Kindred was aware of that fact . Nothing in the record nsupports either proposition . Willocks xe2 x80 x99s own declaration states , in reference to the ndocument , that xe2 x80 x9csomeone called Kindred xe2 x80 x99s complaint line . xe2 x80 x9d [ Doc . 38-3 at 4 . ] I n ntherefore find it unnecessary to decide whether Exhibit A should be stricken as n n14Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 15 of 45 n ninadmissible at trial . As it is probative of none of the arguments advanced by Willocks , the document Will simply not add anything to my analysis . n B . The bulk of the statements in Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s declaration are ninadmissible as being beyond the scope of the witness xe2 x80 x99s ncompetency . n Kindred also argues that the Thigpen declaration is inadmissible . [ Doc . 39 nat 6-8 . ] Kindred xe2 x80 x99s argument on this point is a bit scattershot , alternatively nasserting that the declaration is irrelevant , hearsay , and impermissible 1ay opinion ntestimony , Without developing or separating those contentions . [ See id . ] n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states that , in order to be considered in nsupport or opposition to a motion , a declaration xe2 x80 x9cmust be made on personal nknowledge . xe2 x80 x9d Fed . R. CiV . P. 56 ( c ) ( 4 ) . It makes sense that a party can not create a nfactual issue by having a Witness make a statement that is outside the scope of his npersonal knowledge , and the principle excluding such evidence is not a new one . See Cha xef xac x82ee & Co. v. United States , 85 US . 516 , 543 ( 1873 ) . Accordingly , a n ndeclaration that a Witness xe2 x80 x9cbelieves xe2 x80 x9d a fact to be true is typically insufficient to n ncreate a genuine issue as to the existence of that fact . See Pace v. Capobianco , n n283 F.3d 1275 , 1278 xe2 x80 x9479 ( 11th Cir . 2002 ) . n n15Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 16 of 45 n The declaration , in order to be considered , also must xe2 x80 x9cset out facts that nwould be admissible in evidence . xe2 x80 x9d Fed . R. CiV . P. 56 ( c ) ( 4 ) . Through the Federal Rules of Evidence , the xe2 x80 x9cpersonal knowledge xe2 x80 x9d requirement extends to lay opinion ntestimony . For non-expert Witnesses , testimony in the form of an opinion is nlimited to opinions xe2 x80 x9crationally based on the witness xe2 x80 x99s perception . xe2 x80 x9d Fed . R. EVid . n701 ( a ) . The advisory notes to Rule 701 state that subsection ( a ) codified xe2 x80 x9cthe nfamiliar requirement of first xe2 x80 x94hand knowledge of observation . xe2 x80 x9d Fed . R. EVid . 701 , nadvisory committee notes , 1972 proposed rules . Rule 701 also requires that lay nopinion testimony be xe2 x80 x9chelpful to clearly understanding the witness xe2 x80 x99s testimony or nto determining a fact in issue . xe2 x80 x9d Fed . R. EVid . 701 ( b ) . n As cited by Kindred , the Second Circuit has held that opinion testimony nabout the motivation for an adverse employment action is inadmissible under Rule 701 ( b ) , because the witness xe2 x80 x99s opinion Will not be helpful , and the jury can nreach its own conclusions about the employer xe2 x80 x99s motivations . Hester v. Bic Corp , n225 F.3d 178 , 185 ( 2d Cir . 2000 ) . Hester was based only on Rule 701 ( b ) because nthe parties disclaimed a Rule 701 ( a ) argument . See id . at 181 . Applying the Hester holding to its fullest extent may contradict Rule 704 , Which states that n nopinion testimony is not xe2 x80 x9c [ a ] utomatica11y . . . objectionable just because it n n16Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 17 of 45 n nembraces an ultimate issue . xe2 x80 x9d Fed . R. EVid . 704 . Nevertheless , the underlying nprinciple remains that a witness may not offer a wholly conclusory opinion nwithout demonstrating that it is based on personal observations . Cf . Carter 12. DecisionOne Corp. , 122 F.3d 997 , 1005 ( 11th Cir . 1997 ) ( holding that it was not nplain error to admit testimony regarding an employer xe2 x80 x99s animus where the nwitnesses offered their opinions at the conclusion of their testimony and the nopinion was based on their perceptions ) . n In light of the governing rules and principles , portions of Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s ndeclaration are inadmissible . I find paragraphs 1 through 6 , t0 the extent nprobative , to be properly admissible . The opinions contained in these paragraphs nthat Willocks was an xe2 x80 x9cexcellent employee xe2 x80 x9d and that Carter should have been nwritten up for her verbal altercation with Willocks are based on Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s factual ndeclarations that he was Willocks xe2 x80 x99s direct supervisor and that he witnessed the nverbal altercation , respectively . [ Doc . 38-2 M 1-6 . ] Likewise , paragraphs 8 , 11 , n13 , and 15 , with the exception of Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s conclusion that Willocks xe2 x80 x99s high nblood pressure was based on work-related stress , are admissible as based on n nobservations plausibly within the witness xe2 x80 x99s personal knowledge . [ See doc . 38-2 . ] n n17Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 18 of 45 n The remaining paragraphs of Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s declaration , however , are not nadmissible . In paragraphs 7 , 9 , and 10 , Thigpen offers a conclusion , in different nphrasing , that Hoffmann discriminated against older employees . The additional nstatement in paragraph 9 that Hoffmann xe2 x80 x9cgot her orders from the Headquarters in Florida xe2 x80 x9d is unsupported by any statement that would suggest how such a fact ncould be within Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s personal knowledge ( or , for that matter , what it nactually means ) . Paragraph 14 similarly offers an unsupported conclusion that Kindred , as an institution , discriminated against Willocks because of a race , naccent , and national origin . The fact that paragraph 14 xe2 x80 x99s opinion is purportedly n xe2 x80 x9c [ b ] ased on [ Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s ] observations , xe2 x80 x9d and Thigpen generally stated in paragraph n2 that he has xe2 x80 x9cpersonal knowledge of the facts set forth in this Declaration xe2 x80 x9d is not nsufficient to support Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s conclusory opinions about the motivations of nothers . See Pace , 283 F.3d at 1279. n It should be noted that Thigpen xe2 x80 x99s declaration is not the only one in this case nthat contains information beyond the scope of the witness xe2 x80 x99s personal knowledge . For example , Schimtt xe2 x80 x99s declaration contains descriptions of events that he was not npresent for . [ See Doc . 36-4 HI 9 , 13 . ] I will not go through each declaration here n nto exclude evidence that was not objected to . But , I also will not rely on any n n18Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 19 of 45 n npiece of evidence that is blatantly outside of the personal knowledge of the nwitness .

See Desert Palace , Inc. 12 . Costa , 539 US . 90 , 99-100 ( 2003 ) ( stating the general principle in discussing jury ninstructions in mixed-motive Title VII cases ) . In McDonnell Douglas , the Supreme Court set up a three-step framework for proving employment ndiscrimination claims using circumstantial evidence . The plaintiff first has to npresent a prima facie case of discrimination . Wilson v. B/E Aerospace , Inc. , 376 F.3d 1079 , 1087 ( 11th Cir . 2004 ) . The prima facie case creates a presumption nthat the plaintiff was subjected to discrimination . Id . The burden of production nthen shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate , non-discriminatory reason nfor the challenged employment action . Id . If the defendant is able to offer such a nreason , the presumption of discrimination is rebutted , and the burden of nproduction shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant xe2 x80 x99s justification is n njust a pretext for discrimination .

There is no direct evidence of age discrimination . n Willocks contends that there is sufficient direct evidence of age ndiscrimination to defeat summary judgment . [ Doc . 38 at 1 . ] Specifically , Willocks cites to xe2 x80 x9cDefendant xe2 x80 x99s statement to Plaintiff that it wanted to xe2 x80 x98get rid of xe2 x80 x99 nolder employees by xe2 x80 x98Writing them up . xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x99 [ Id . at 2 . ] n Kindred disputes that Hoffmann ever made the statement as alleged by Willocks . [ D0c . 36-1 at 4-5 . ] It states that Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony regarding that nconversation is xe2 x80 x9cso lacking in credibility xe2 x80 x9d that it should be disregarded . [ Id . at 4- n5 & n.8 . ] Kindred also argues that Hoffmann stopped working for Kindred long n nbefore Willocks was fired . [ Id . at 4-5 . ] Accordingly , Kindred argues that the n n22Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 23 of 45 n ncomment can not have been related to the decision to fire Willocks , and therefore nis not direct evidence of discrimination . [ Id . at 5 . ] n Willocks responds that Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement can represent nothing other nthan age-based discrimination , and thus is direct evidence . [ Doc . 38 at 1-2 . ] She nargues that the issue of whether the statement was made is a jury question . [ Id . at n2 . ] She also argues that Hoffmann was a decision maker at the time she made the nstatement , and therefore her statement reveals the intent of Kindred . [ Id . at 2 . ] Willocks contends that the most important fact is that she was subjected to nharassment and harsh treatment when she refused to participate in and reported Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s scheme to Kindred . [ Id . ] n Kindred , in reply , reiterates its contention that Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement is nsupported by Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony alone . [ Doc . 39 at 8-9 . ] It also reiterates that neven if we were to assume xe2 x80 x9carguendo xe2 x80 x9d that Hoffmann made the statements , there nis no factual dispute that Hoffmann left Kindred well before Willocks was fired . n [ Id . at 9 . ] They further argue that Willocks failed to demonstrate that the n n99 n nstatement by a non-decision maker constitutes a xe2 x80 x9cstray remar and can not be n ndirect evidence of discrimination . [ Id . at 9-10 . ] n n23Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 24 of 45 n As an initial matter , Kindred xe2 x80 x99s argument that the Court should disregard Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony about Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement barely warrants serious nconsideration . It is a basic principle of summary judgment that reasonable factual ninferences should be made in favor of the nonmovant . See Tolan , 134 S.Ct . at n1868 . Kindred xe2 x80 x99s only argument that Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony is xe2 x80 x9cso lacking in ncredibility xe2 x80 x9d that it would be unreasonable to believe it is the implication that the Plaintiff can not credibly offer testimony that is in her favor . [ See Doc . 36-1 at 4- n5 . ] Such an argument is contradicted by binding case law and basic principles of njustice . See Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach , 707 F.3d 1244 , 1253 ( 11th Cir . n2013 ) ( self xe2 x80 x94serving statements are admissible and can be sufficient to create an nissue of fact so long as they are based on personal knowledge ) . Kindred could ncertainly argue to a jury that the self xe2 x80 x94serving nature of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony nshould give the jury pause before accepting the testimony as true . But , for npurposes of this summary judgment motion , it is accepted as true ( not arguendo ) nthat Hoffmann told Willocks that she wanted to get rid of employees that were nolder than Hoffmann . [ See Doc . 36-2 at 7-8 . ] n Nevertheless , Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statements do not amount to direct evidence that n Kindred fired Willocks because of her age . Willocks bases her argument that n n24Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 25 of 45 n Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s comments constitute direct evidence is direct on the case Van Voorhis v. Hillsborough County Board of County Commissioners , 512 F.3d 1296 n ( 11th Cir . 2008 ) . In Van Voorhis , there was evidence that a manager in charge of nhiring for the defendant declined to interview the plaintiff and others because he nsaid that xe2 x80 x9che didn xe2 x80 x99t want to hire an old pilot . xe2 x80 x9d See 512 F.3d at 1298 . The Circuit Court held that constituted sufficient direct evidence of discrimination to defeat nsummary judgment . Id . at 1300 . The standard , as stated in Van Voorhis , of n xe2 x80 x9cdirect evidence xe2 x80 x9d is xe2 x80 x9cevidence that re xef xac x82ects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude ncorrelating t0 the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee . xe2 x80 x9d Id . ( quotation omitted ) . The Circuit has further stated that , in order to be direct nevidence of discrimination , an offending statement must xe2 x80 x9cbe made concurrently With the adverse employment event , such that no inference is necessary to nconclude that the bias necessarily motivated the decision . xe2 x80 x9d Williamson 12. Adventist Health Sys./Sunbelt , Inc. , 372 F. App xe2 x80 x99x 936 , 940 ( 11th Cir . 2010 ) , nciting Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets 0f Fla. , 1116. , 196 F.3d 1354 , 1359 ( 11th Cir . 1999 ) . n Willocks is likely correct that Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement was sufficiently n nblatant to meet the standard . However , the statement is not connected to the n n25Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 26 of 45 n nadverse employment action complained of here . Hoffmann made the statement to Willocks in the context of potentially terminating other employees . Willocks was nnot fired until at least a year after Hoffmann left the company . There is no nevidence beyond mere conjecture that would impute Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement onto nothers at Kindred . In short , even allowing for reasonable inferences , it would be nunreasonable to conclude that Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement , as re xef xac x82ective as it may be nthat Hoffmann harbored a discriminatory animus when she said it , bears any ndirect relationship to Willocks xe2 x80 x99s firing . Willocks simply can not point to any ndirect evidence of discrimination . n Willocks also argues that the statement is direct evidence because xe2 x80 x9cat the ntime the statement was made , it was by a decision maker . xe2 x80 x9d [ Doc . 38 at 2 . ] I am nnot entirely sure what Willocks means by this . The xe2 x80 x9cdecision maker xe2 x80 x9d in an nemployment case is not a status that is reached by an employee once he or she has nthe ability to make employment decisions . Rather , xe2 x80 x9cdecision maker xe2 x80 x9d refers to the nspecific person or people who made an employment decision . I am unable to find na single case that would suggest otherwise . Calling Hoffmann a decision maker n n xe2 x80 x9cat the time xe2 x80 x9d has no legal significance . n n26Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 27 of 45 n n2 . Willocks can not make out a prima facie case of age ndiscrimination . n To make out a prima facie case under the ADEA , the plaintiff must show : n ( 1 ) that she was a member of a protected age class ; ( 2 ) she was subjected to an nadverse employment action ; ( 3 ) that a substantially younger person filled the nposition from which she was discharged ; and ( 4 ) she was qualified to do the job . n Kragor v. Takeda Pharm . Am. , Inc. , 702 F.3d 1304 , 1308 ( 11th Cir . 2012 ) . n na . There is suf xef xac x81cient evidence that would support a n xef xac x81nding that Willocks was quali xef xac x81ed for the position nthat she held . n Kindred argues that Willocks was not qualified for her position under the nmeaning of the ADEA because she was not meeting Kindred xe2 x80 x99s legitimate nexpectations and objective qualifications for the job . [ Doc . 36-1 at 7 . ] Specifically , they argue that Willocks xe2 x80 x99s falsification of documents , failure to nprovide documents to her supervisor rather than to the state auditor , and poor ndisciplinary history as reasons that she was no longer qualified for the job . [ Id . at n7-8 . ] n Willocks responds that she worked for Kindred for 20 years before being n nwritten up for the first time in 2011 . [ Doc . 38 at 3 . ] Further , she argues that the n nfactual bases for the times she was disciplined are disputed .

Atlanta Indep . Sch . Sys. , 408 F.3d 763 , 769 ( 11th Cir . 2005 ) . The Court in Vessels warned that subjective evaluations should not be considered at this stage . Id . Only objectively verifiable and information easily obtainable by the plaintiff nshould be considered . Id . To allow a defendant to argue that subjective nevaluations render the plaintiff unqualified would force the plaintiff to litigate npretext at the prima facie stage . Id . n To support its argument that Willocks is unqualified for her job based on nher performance , Kindred cites to Daniels 12 . Hale , 350 F. App xe2 x80 x99x 380 , 385 ( 11th Cir . 2009 ) . In Daniels , the Court held that the plaintiff was not qualified for the njob because xe2 x80 x9cobjective evaluations xe2 x80 x9d by witnesses established that she was unable nto communicate and handle telephone calls at the level of effectiveness required nfor the job . 350 F. App xe2 x80 x99x at 385 . Daniels , however , is unpublished and non- nbinding . I do not find Daniels to be persuasive . The conclusion that the plaintiff nin Daniels was bad at her job was a subjective conclusion , even if based on clear nobservations . The evaluations did not go to the sort of xe2 x80 x9cobjectively verifiable xe2 x80 x9d n nfact , like possession of a professional certification , that is ordinarily considered at n n28Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 29 of 45 n nthis stage .

The evaluations in Daniels at least went to the plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s ninability to perform basic tasks that were required for the job . Here , Kindred npoints to no more than what essentially amounts to asserted insubordination to nshow Willocks xe2 x80 x99s lack of qualifications . Even if its allegations were undisputedly ntrue , Kindred has pointed to nothing that shows that Willocks was less than ncapable of doing the job . In other words , for purposes of the prima facie case , Willocks was qualified for her position . n nb . Willocks has not produced or pointed to any nevidence that anybody younger than her was treated nmore favorably than she was treated . n Kindred also argues that Willocks can not make out a prima facie case nbecause she has not identified a comparator who replaced her or was treated more nfavorably than her . [ Doc . 36-1 at 8 . ] Moreover , Kindred argues that Willocks n nhas not pointed to anyone else over 40 who was also fired . [ Id . ] n Willocks xe2 x80 x99s response brief does not address the comparator issue . n n29Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 30 of 45 n There does not appear to be any evidence in the record regarding who nultimately replaced Willocks after she was fired . Moreover , there does not appear nto be any evidence suggesting that a younger employee was treated more nfavorably . The only evidence regarding other employees is Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony nregarding the three employees that she believed Hoffmann had targeted for firing . The evidence suggests , however , that those employees were older and were not nfired . Accordingly , Willocks can not state a prima facie case under the ADEA , nbecause she has not identified or presented evidence of a single plausible ncomparator . Moreover , Willocks does not argue that a comparator would not be nrequired in this case , and I can discern of no reason to reach that conclusion . n Without direct evidence or a prima facie case of age discrimination , Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s ADEA claim . n D . Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s ADA nclaim because there is no evidence that she was disabled . n Kindred argues that Willocks has failed to show that she is disabled , nbecause she failed to present any evidence that her high blood pressure or ndiabetes affected a major life activity . [ D0c . 36-1 at 16 . ] Even assuming Willocks was disabled , Kindred argues that she has failed to show that she n nrequested an accommodation that Kindred failed to provide .

The local rule does not speak to the consequence nof responding to a motion but failing to respond to a specific portion or argument Within the motion . Because the rule lacks such a requirement , and because the nmovant has the ultimate burden of showing entitlement to summary judgment , I Will review the merits of Kindred xe2 x80 x99s motion as to the ADA claim . n The ADA , as amended by the ADAAA , prohibits discrimination xe2 x80 x9cagainst a nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application nprocedures , the hiring , advancement , or discharge of employees , employee ncompensation , job training , and other terms , conditions , and privileges of nemployment . xe2 x80 x9d 42 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 12112 ( a ) .

See Lucas 12 . WW . Grainger , Inc. , 257 F.3d 1249 , n1255 xe2 x80 x9456 ( 11th Cir . 2001 ) .7 n The ADAAA and its governing regulations define a xe2 x80 x9cdisability xe2 x80 x9d as xe2 x80 x9c ( A ) a nphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major nlife activities of such individual ; ( B ) a record of such impairment ; or ( C ) being nregarded as having such an impairment . . . . xe2 x80 x9d 42 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 12102 ( 1 ) ; 29 C.F.R . xc2 xa7 n1630.2 ( g ) ( 1 ) .

This phrasing suggests that a plaintiff must prove the ultimate nquestion of the case xe2 x80 x94Whether unlawful discrimination occurred xe2 x80 x94as part of her nprima facie case . See Holly v. Clairson Indus , L.L.C. , 492 F.3d 1247 , 1255-56 n ( 11th Cir . 2007 ) ( stating the third element as xe2 x80 x9c [ plaintiff ] was subjected to nunlawful discrimination because of his disability xe2 x80 x9d ) . As Judge Vining of this Court has noted , the Circuit has xe2 x80 x9cconsistently formulated the third prong in this nmanner , xe2 x80 x9d even though the formulation is incorrect . See Brandon v. Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Sys. , 393 F. Supp . 2d 1341 , 1345 ( N.D. Ga. 2005 ) . Judge Vining further noted that , in practice , the Circuit has only required xe2 x80 x9ca plaintiff to npresent facts from Which an inference of discrimination can be made ( as is true in nall other discrimination cases ) , xe2 x80 x9d Which , at the third prong , only meant showing an nadverse employment action that could be actionable under the ADA occurred . n n32Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 33 of 45 n The ADAAA provides a non xe2 x80 x94exhaustive list of xe2 x80 x9cmajor life activities . xe2 x80 x9d 42 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 12102 ( 2 ) ( A ) .

Here , Willocks nadmitted as true that she was not restricted as to any work activity . [ Doc . 36-8 M n72-73 . ] Further , there is no evidence in the record that Willocks was substantially nlimited in any other activity outside of work . Accordingly , I find that there is not na triable issue of fact as to whether Willocks was disabled . Thus , Kindred is nentitled to summary judgment on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s ADA claim . n E . Kindred is entitled to summary judgment as to Willocks xe2 x80 x99s race , ncolor , national origin , and accent claims . n n1 . There is no direct evidence of discrimination .

Carroll , 529 F.3d 961 , 970 ( 11th Cir . n n2008 ) . n Kindred broadly argues that Willocks can not make out a prima facie case nof discrimination because she can not establish a causal connection between her ntermination and a protected characteristic . [ Doc . 36-1 at 18-19 . ] The entire n npurpose of the prima facie requirement under McDonnell Douglas is that it n ncreates a presumption of causation because direct evidence is often missing .

The substance of Kindred xe2 x80 x99s argument is better suited for an argument nthat Willocks is unable to show pretext . n Despite Kindred xe2 x80 x99s misplaced argument , Willocks still can not make out a nprima facie case . Just as With the ADEA claim , there is no evidence of a ncomparator of any protected group different from Willocks Who was treated more nfavorably than Willocks . The only evidence in the record concerning other npotentially similarly situated Kindred employees involves individuals Who were nof the same purported race as Willocks . There is no information in the record nabout the national origin of those employees . Without any evidence of a similarly nsituated comparator , Willocks can not make out a prima facie case of race ndiscrimination based on circumstantial evidence . n F . Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s nretaliation claims . n A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under xc2 xa7 1981 Where nshe shows that : ( 1 ) she engaged in statutorily protected activity ; ( 2 ) she suffered a nmaterially adverse action ; and ( 3 ) there was a causal connection between the n nprotected activity and the adverse action .

[ Doc . 36-1 at 21 . ] Kindred nargues that there is no evidence that Willocks ever complained to any official nabout any discrimination at the company . [ Id . at 22 . ] Further , while Willocks nargues that she refused to go along With Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s directive to fire older , Hispanic employees , there is no evidence that she voiced that refusal .

Id . The Supreme Court has held that retaliation claims are cognizable under xc2 xa7 1981 as nwell . See CBOCS West , Inc. v. Humphries , 553 US . 442 , 457 ( 2008 ) . n Interpreting Title VII , the Supreme Court has held that opposition need not ntake the form of an employee instigating some sort of action or vocal opposition . See Crawford v. Metro . Gov xe2 x80 x99t ofNashville & Davidson Cty. , Tenn , 555 US . 271 , n277 ( 2009 ) . While possibly dicta , the Court stated that it xe2 x80 x9cwould call it n xe2 x80 x98opposition xe2 x80 x99 if an employee took a stand against an employer xe2 x80 x99s discrimination not nby xe2 x80 x98instigating xe2 x80 x99 action , but by standing pat , say , by refusing to follow a nsupervisor xe2 x80 x99s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons . xe2 x80 x9d Id.9 n I agree With Kindred that there is no evidence in the record that Willocks nverbally opposed Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s statement . Willocks xe2 x80 x99s testimony that she warned nher fellow co-workers to be careful is likely insufficient . Moreover , the nanonymous tip line complaint , With zero evidence in the record that Willocks n nmade that complaint , is also insufficient . n n9 Because this analysis involves interpretation of the specific language in Title VII , I am not sure Whether the same standards would apply to the xc2 xa7 1981 nretaliation claim . I need not reach that issue , however , because there is no reason nthat the analysis regarding the causation issue would not apply to the xc2 xa7 1981 nclaim . n n39Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 40 of 45 n Reading the evidence most favorably to Willocks , however , she may have nopposed Hoffmann simply by not writing up the employees as directed by Hoffmann . [ See Doc . 36-8 M 61-62 . ] It may be problematic for Willocks , nhowever , that Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s directive seems to have been more explicitly ndiscriminatory 0n the basis of age , not race , and Willocks xe2 x80 x99s retaliation Claim is nasserted under Title VII . I Will not decide if that nuance is dispositive , however , nbecause , even assuming that Willocks opposed an unlawful employment practice nfor Title VII purposes , I readily conclude that Willocks can not state a prima facie ncase because she can not show a causal connection between an adverse nemployment action and protected activity . n n2 . There is no evidence in the record that would support a nconclusion that there was a causal link between any nopposition on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s part and her xef xac x81ring . n The causal link element of the prima facie case is construed broadly . Gate Gourmet , 683 F.3d at 1260 .

HI 6 . ] At the time that she was fired , Willocks reported to Bob Tvrdik , the Director of Plant Operations , and Tvrdik reported to Michael Schmitt , the Chief Executive Officer ( xe2 x80 x9cCEO xe2 x80 x9d ) . [ Id . HI 7 . ] n A . Willocks xe2 x80 x99s Conversation and Interactions with Sally Hoffmann n In June 2011 or May 2012,2 interim CEO Sally Hoffmann told Willocks nthat she wanted her to write up older , Hispanic employees in order to get them nfired . [ Doc . 36-8 HI 55 , 58 . ] Willocks believed that Hoffmann wanted to get rid nof those employees because newer employees would be paid less and because nolder employees would be eligible for Social Security if fired . [ Id . M 61-62 . ] Regarding that conversation , Willocks testified xe2 x80 x9c [ Hoffmann ] said to me , we need nto cut staff . We need to only have four employees here daily . She says what we nneed to do is get rid of the old employees , the ones that can get Social Security . n The employees older than [ Hoffmann ] 3 , that xe2 x80 x99s what she said . xe2 x80 x9d [ Doc . 36-2 at 7-8 . ] n n2 There was con xef xac x82icting testimony as to when this conversation occurred . As Hoffmann was no longer with Kindred as of April 2012 , I presume that the June 2011 date is the correct one . For purposes of this motion , it is sufficient to npresume that the conversation happened at some point during Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s tenure nas interim CEO . n n3 Willocks initially said xe2 x80 x9colder than me , xe2 x80 x9d but later clarified that she was nreferring to employees older than Hoffmann . n n5Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 41 of 45 n Kindred argues that Willocks can not show a causal link between her nopposition and her firing because the two events xe2 x80 x9cmust be temporally proximate xe2 x80 x9d nin order to establish causation . [ Doc . 36-1 at 23-24 . ] Kindred xe2 x80 x99s statement of the nlaw is not precisely correct . The law states that the two events must be xe2 x80 x9cvery nclose xe2 x80 x9d in time in order for a plaintiff to rely on temporal proximity alone to nestablish a causal link . See Brown v. Ala. Dep xe2 x80 x99t of Transp. , 597 F.3d 1160 , 1182 n ( 11th Cir . 2010 ) , citing Clark Cty . Sch . Dist . v. Breeden , 532 U.S. 268 , 273 n ( 2001 ) . A plaintiff can still show causation Where there is not close temporal nproximity , but she needs to point to other evidence suggestive of causation . Id . n Willocks appears to concede that the temporal gap between her possible nopposition and her firing is too long to be sufficient on its own . [ See Doc . 38 at n10 . ] Even if not conceded , I readily conclude that the gap is too long . This Circuit has drawn the line on the sufficiency of temporal proximity alone at nsomewhere between seven weeks and three months . See Brown , 597 F.3d at n1182 ; Farley v. Nationwide Mut . Ins . C0. , 197 F.3d 1322 , 1337 ( 11th Cir . 1999 ) . The gap here was over a year . Moreover , there was an intervening change in n ncorporate leadership . n n41Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 42 of 45 n Willocks argues that the termination is sufficiently close xe2 x80 x9cconsidering how n n9 n nclearly the two square . xe2 x80 x99 I really am not sure what Willocks means by this nargument . To the extent Willocks is arguing that her firing was re xef xac x82ective of Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s previously stated desire to fire older employees , such an argument nwould undermine a claim that a retaliatory animus motivated her firing . n Willocks also argues that intervening retaliatory conduct creates a nsufficient causal link between her opposition to Hoffmann xe2 x80 x99s plan and her firing . n [ Doc . 38 at 10 . ] But Willocks argues that each of these events occurred shortly nafter her opposition . [ Id . ] While that may permit a finding that some of the nintermediate conduct was retaliatory , the only alleged adverse employment action nis Willocks xe2 x80 x99s firing . All of the alleged intermediary treatment appears to have nbeen at the hands of Hoffmann , who left the company long before Willocks was nfired . [ See id . ; Doc . 38-3 M 13-15 . ] Accordingly , even if the intermediary nconduct were clearly retaliatory , that conduct occurred too long before Willocks nwas fired to create an inference that Willocks xe2 x80 x99s eventual termination was the nresult of retaliation . Moreover , as Kindred points out , short of assertions of a n nconspiracy , there is no evidence in the record that anyone employed by Kindred n nat the time of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s firing was even aware of Willocks xe2 x80 x99s possible opposition n n42Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 43 of 45 n nt0 Hoffmann . In sum , Willocks can not meet the causation prong 0f the prima nfacie case , and Kindred is entitled to summary judgment on Willocks xe2 x80 x99s retaliation nclaims as well . n G . A brief discussion of pretext . n I am recommending a conclusion that Willocks has not made out a prima nfacie case on any of her claims . It is therefore unnecessary to reach the parties xe2 x80 x99 narguments about whether the evidence could show that Kindred xe2 x80 x99s stated reasons nfor firing Willocks were pretext for discrimination or retaliation . Nevertheless , ngiven the advisory function of this report , I will brie xef xac x82y address the parties xe2 x80 x99 narguments on that issue . n Kindred asserts that its legitimate non-discriminatory reason for firing Willocks was that she falsified documents for use in a state audit and that she nprovided the documents directly to the state auditor despite being instructed by a nsupervisor to not do that . [ D0c . 36-1 at 9 . ] This is sufficient to meet Kindred xe2 x80 x99s nlight burden at this stage . See Wilson , 376 F.3d at 1087 . The inquiry next turns nto whether Willocks can point to sufficient evidence that could demonstrate that Kindred xe2 x80 x99s stated reasons were mere pretext for discrimination . Willocks can not n nmeet that burden . n n43Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 44 of 45 n Willocks does not really dispute the factual underpinnings of Kindred xe2 x80 x99s nproffered reasoning . Specifically , Willocks concedes that she input the old data nonto a new form and that she gave some paperwork directly to the state auditor . n [ See Doc . 38 at 4-5 ; Doc . 36-8 HI 41 . ] Willocks disputes the conclusions that Kindred reached based on those facts . She argues that the transfer of data from none form to another does not amount to forgery 0r falsification , and that she was nunderstandably acting at the direction of the auditor when she gave the auditor the nrequested documents . [ See Doc . 38 at 4-7 . ] n A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the employer xe2 x80 x99s n nproffered reasons for an adverse employment action are xe2 x80 x9cunworthy of credence . xe2 x80 x9d n See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. , Inc. , 530 US . 133 , 143 ( 2000 ) n ( quotation omitted ) . Willocks xe2 x80 x99s dispute with Kindred xe2 x80 x99s interpretation of her nactions does not rise to that level . In essence , Willocks argues that she acted nreasonably , and therefore did not deserve to be fired . [ See Doc . 38 at 5 ( arguing nthat her transferring of data was less severe than a true forgery and that she may nhave had a duty to follow the auditor xe2 x80 x99s instruction ) . ] Willocks argues that it nshould be a question for the jury whether her actions warranted her firing . But , n nthe Court xe2 x80 x99s ( and the jury xe2 x80 x99s ) role in discrimination cases is to xe2 x80 x9cprevent unlawful n n44Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446-AT Document 43 Filed 06/06/17 Page 45 of 45 n n [ employment ] practices , not to act as a super personnel department that second- nguesses employers xe2 x80 x99 business judgments . xe2 x80 x9d See Wilson , 376 F.3d at 1092 . The Court in Wilson made clear that the plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s arguments that the defendant erred nin judgment in finding her to be insubordinate was insufficient to establish a ndiscriminatory animus . Here , even accepting Willocks xe2 x80 x99s contention that her ntransgressions were not as severe as Kindred asserts , she has not and can not point nto evidence in the record that Kindred acted out of a discriminatory or a nretaliatory animus of any kind , or that Kindred xe2 x80 x99s stated reasons for firing her were nso far from the truth that it would suggest that Kindred was lying . Accordingly , neven if Willocks could make out a prima facie case on any of her claims , she nwould not be able to demonstrate that Kindred xe2 x80 x99s stated reasons for firing her were npretext for discrimination or retaliation . n V .

Therefore , in accordance with 28 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 636 ( b ) ( 1 ) and Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the Court has reviewed the Magistrate Judge xe2 x80 x99s Recommendation for Clear error as to those claims and xef xac x81nds nnone . The Court therefore AD OPTS those portions of the R & R as the opinion of nthe Court . n Plaintiff does object to the dismissal of her Age Discrimination in Employment Act ( xe2 x80 x9cADEA xe2 x80 x9d ) claim and her retaliation claim under Title VII and xc2 xa7 n1981 . The Court reviews that portion of the R & R de novo . Fed . R. CiV . P. 72 ( b ) ; n28 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 636 ( b ) . The Court xef xac x81nds that the Magistrate Judge xe2 x80 x99s R & R is largely ncorrect and therefore OVERRULES Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Objections . n First , Plaintiff objects that the R & R erred when it concluded that Sally Hoffman xe2 x80 x99s statements to Plaintiff in 2011 asking Plaintiff to help Hoffman xef xac x81re nolder works are direct evidence that Plaintiff was discriminated against on the nbasis of age when she was terminated in 2013 .

Kindred xe2 x80 x99s scheme to nterminate Plaintif . xe2 x80 x9d ( Objs . at 2 . ) But xe2 x80 x9c [ d ] irect evidence is evidence that nestablishes the existence of discriminatory intent behind the employment n n3 n ndecision without any inference or presumption . xe2 x80 x99 Tiggs-Vaughn v.

The R & R also correctly observes that ndiscriminatory statements that are distant in time from an adverse employment ndecision are generally not direct evidence . And Plaintiff does not provide nevidence connecting Hoffman xe2 x80 x99s statements with that of other Kindred nmanagement level employees , like Carter ( who was also involved in the events nsurroundin g Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 termin ation ) . n Plaintiff also objects that she made out a prima facie case of ndiscrimination , and that the R & R erred when it concluded Plaintiff had failed to npoint to a comparator . Plaintiff objects that xe2 x80 x9cothers were treated more favorably nthan Plaintiff xe2 x80 x94 they were not terminated xe2 x80 x94 while Plaintiff was terminated . xe2 x80 x9d n ( Objs . at 2 . ) But Plaintiff does not identify a single person by name , and does not nshow how they are in fact appropriate comparators by addressing whether or not nthey were similarly situated . n Plaintiff next objects that she did create a genuine issue of fact as to nwhether her opposition to Hoffman xe2 x80 x99s and Kindred xe2 x80 x99s alleged scheme to terminate nolder employees was causally connected to her own termination . But the record nshows that Hoffman xe2 x80 x99s statements and the alleged campaign of harassment nagainst Plaintiff all occurred long before Plaintiff was xef xac x81red . And as the R & R nobserves , Hoffman stepped down as CEO and new management took her place . n The gap between Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s opposition and her eventual termination is too lon g toCase 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404446 xe2 x80 x94AT Document 47 Filed 06/28/17 Page 5 of 5 n nsustain her claim . Finally , the Court agrees that Plaintiff can not show pretext for nthe reasons identified in the R & R . n The Court acknowledges that Plaintiff was a 22-year veteran at Kindred . It xe2 x80 x99s more than possible that Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s termination was unfair , given her many nyears of service . But it was not unlawful . Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Objections are OVERRULED .

Defendants submit no evidence of a contract or nunjust enrichment beyond the allegations in their counterclaim . n Plaintiffs argue that FLSA minimum wage rights xe2 x80 x9dcannot be abridged by n ncontract or otherwise waived . xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 45-5 at 28. xe2 x80 x9dBecause [ they ] were n n21 n A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 22 of 23 n nemployees , xe2 x80 x9d Plaintiffs say , any breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law . Li . at 29. xe2 x80 x9d [ T ] o the extent that Defendants xe2 x80 x99 counterclaim constitutes a claim for nunjust enrichment , xe2 x80 x9d that too fails because xe2 x80 x9dPlaintiffs received all their monies xe2 x80 x9d nfrom customers . Li . at 29-30. n Whether breach of contract or unjust enrichment , Defendants xe2 x80 x99 ncounterclaims perish . As the party moving for summary judgment , Plaintiffs nbore the initial burden of , at a minimum , pointing out an absence of evidence to nsupport Defendants xe2 x80 x99 claims . xef xac x82 Celotex Corp. V. Catrett , 477 US . 317 , 323 n ( 1986 ) . They met that burden . xef xac x82 doc . 45-5 at 28-30 . Defendants then had to n xe2 x80 x9dgo beyond the pleadings and by xe2 x80 x9d the evidence on file show xe2 x80 x9dthat there is a ngenuine [ dispute ] for trial . xe2 x80 x9d Li . at 324. n Unfortunately , no evidence on file exists because Defendants never nsubmitted anything to support their claims . Nor do they argue their point . Instead , defense counsel xe2 x80 x9drespectfully refers xe2 x80 x9d the Court to four case citations , nthen concludes that xe2 x80 x9dthere were valid contracts between plaintiffs and the club , nthere was a breach , and there was damage .

CONCLUSION n The Court accordingly finds that ( 1 ) Plaintiffs are employees , not nindependent contractors ; ( 2 ) 1400 is an enterprise subject to the FLSA xe2 x80 x99s minimum n Ill n nwage provisions ; ( 3 ) Jones is an FLSA employer ; ( 4 ) Defendants creative nprofessional xe2 x80 x9d defense fails ; ( 5 ) VIP room fees do not offset Defendants xe2 x80 x99 minimum nwage obligations ; ( 6 ) Defendants paid no wages , and thus Plaintiffs may recover n $ 7.25 per hour plus reimbursement for all fees and fines paid ; and ( 7 ) Defendants xe2 x80 x99 counterclaims fail as a matter of law . n Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 motion for partial summary judgment therefore is GRANTED . Doc . 45 . The parties must submit a proposed pretrial order within thirty days of n nthe date this Order is served . n nso ORDERED , this 15th day of June 2017. n ns 1 Steve C. lones HONORABLE STEVE C.

The alcohol allegation nrelates only to 1400 's possible enterprise liability under the FLSA . As discussed nbelow , collateral estoppel bars relitigation of that issue , which is in any case nsupported by other , uncontested , facts . E doc . 45-1 at 2 1 ] 3 ( xe2 x80 x9d1400 derives nrevenues from fees paid by customers on two ATMs in Swinging Richards , one nof which uses the phone lines and the other of which uses an Internet nconnection . xe2 x80 x9d ) . n Paragraph 84 states that xe2 x80 x9dPlaintiffs receive no wages for their dancing nwork at Swinging Richards . xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 45-1 at 14 . Defendants disagree , stating that n xe2 x80 x9dhouse-set , minimum charges for table dances and VIP Room Visits count as n xe2 x80 x9dwages [ , ] xe2 x80 x9d [ ] not xe2 x80 x9dtips [ , ] xe2 x80 x9d [ ] per the IRS and Department of Labor . xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 52-16 at n3 . That , however , is a legal conclusion that fails to qualify as a valid objection nunder L.R . 561 ( 3 ) ( 2 ) ( a ) ( 2 ) Still , Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9dfact xe2 x80 x9d itself contains hints of nconclusion . Whether Defendants paid xe2 x80 x9dwages xe2 x80 x9d is in some sense the ultimate nissue in this litigation . To the extent paragraph 84 refers to that issue , then , it is nnot deemed admitted . Insofar as it Plaintiffs meant that they do not receive any n nmoney directly from Defendants ( i.e. , that they received money only from n A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 5 of 23 n ncustomers ) , that fact is admitted . n Paragraphs 85-87 relate to Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 knowledge of a previous FLSA nlawsuit against the same defendants as in this case , and of their ability to opt xe2 x80 x94in nto its settlement . Doc . 45-1 at 14-15 . Defendants xe2 x80 x99 object that xe2 x80 x9d [ w ] hat plaintiffs nknew can not be determined without a thorough testing and examination of their ncredibility . xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 52-16 at 3 . But that is not a L.R . 56.1-compliant objection xe2 x80 x94it ndoes not directly refute Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 proferred fact , it does not object to nadmissibility , and it does not highlight a lack of evidentiary support . The Court ntherefore deems paragraphs 85-87 admitted . n Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 Statement of Undisputed Fact , all of which the Court deems nadmitted , forms the basis for what follows . n II . BACKGROUND n n xe2 x80 x9dSwinging Richards is a nightclub featuring nude male dancers in Atlanta , Georgia , which is owned and operated by Defendant 1400 Northside Drive , Inc. xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 45-1 at 1 ( Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 Statement of Material Fact ) . 1400 is itself owned by ndefendant CB . Jones , who also owns the property on which the club sits . Li . at n n9 . Plaintiffs Zachary Chastain and Travis Delduca are former male strippers who n nworked at the club from 2013 until late-2016 ( October for Delduca , December for n A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 6 of 23 n Chastain ) . Li . at 3 . Wilson , who began dancing at the club in 2013 , remains nemployed by 1400 . Li . at 3. n n1400 classifies its dancers as independent contractors and compensates nthem exclusively through customer tips . Doc . 45-1 at 14 . It does not , however , n xe2 x80 x9dkeep records of payments made to dancers by customers for performances on nstage . . . [ or ] for table xe2 x80 x94side dances . xe2 x80 x9d Li . at 10 . Cash from VIP room customers nstays in an envelope with the VIP doorman xe2 x80 x9duntil the end of the night , at which ntime the dancer collects it . xe2 x80 x9d Li . at 11 . 1400 issues checks to dancers twenty-four nhours after a VIP roomcustomer pays with a credit card . n In March 2014 , 1400 xe2 x80 x9dbegan having dancers fill out timesheets . xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 45-1 nat 11. xe2 x80 x9d [ T ] hose timesheets contain [ ed ] dancers ' time in and out , total VIP rooms , nand total tips , but not the actual amount earned from VIP dances . xe2 x80 x9d 1400 xe2 x80 x99s naccountant then filed those timesheets , xe2 x80 x9dand did nothing else with them . xe2 x80 x9d Li . n n xe2 x80 x9dAt some point . . . Defendants began having the VIP manager track the namounts of money dancers received in cash for VIP dances xe2 x80 x9d by giving the dancer na receipt . Doc . 45-1 at 13 . That manager never entered the total cash received n namount into xe2 x80 x9dhis computer spreadsheet . xe2 x80 x9d Li . The receipts were xe2 x80 x9dperiodically xe2 x80 x9d n nsent to 1400 's accountant , but he xe2 x80 x9dsimply put them in a box xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94 he did not use the n A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 7 of 23 n nreceipts to calculate revenues for tax return purposes . Li . Instead , the naccountant xe2 x80 x9dextrapolated the dancers xe2 x80 x99 minimum VIP fees based on the length of nthe room rentals recorded on the VIP manager xe2 x80 x99s spreadsheet . xe2 x80 x9d Li . xe2 x80 x9dOn a nmonth xe2 x80 x94to-month basis , the club did nothing to account for the dancers xe2 x80 x99 VIP fees . xe2 x80 x9d Li . Dancers now must write xe2 x80 x9dtheir total cash received on the back of their ntimecards , [ but ] Swinging Richards does nothing with that information for naccounting purposes . xe2 x80 x9d Li . at 14. III . ANALYSIS n Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on seven discreet issues : ( 1 ) whether Plaintiffs were employees or independent contractors ; ( 2 ) whether 1400 xe2 x80 x9dis an n xe2 x80 x99enterprise engaged in commerce xe2 x80 x99 as that term is used in the FLSA and is subject nto the FLSA xe2 x80 x99s minimum wage provisions ; xe2 x80 x9d ( 3 ) whether xe2 x80 x9dJones is a joint nemployer ; xe2 x80 x9d ( 4 ) whether xe2 x80 x9dPlaintiffs are not exempt xe2 x80 x99creative professionals ; xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d ( 5 ) nwhether VIP room and table dance fees qualified as xe2 x80 x9dservice charges xe2 x80 x9d that offset Defendants minimum wage obligations ; ( 6 ) whether Plaintiffs can obtain n $ 7.25/ hr in back wages xe2 x80 x9dfor each hour worked in the statutory limitations period , nin addition to reimbursement of all fees and fines paid ; xe2 x80 x9d and ( 7 ) whether n Defendants xe2 x80 x99 breach of contract and unjust enrichment counterclaims fail . Doc.A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 8 of 23 n n45-5 at 30-31 . They also contend that two orders in another FLSA case brought nby Swinging Richards dancers should bar relitigation of issue one , and issues nthree through seven . Li . at 5 . Before delving into all that , however , a Local Rule nrequires the Court to address Defendants xe2 x80 x99 summary judgment response . n Local Rule 7.1 ( B ) makes clear that xe2 x80 x9d [ f ] ailure to file a response shall indicate nthat there is no opposition to the motion . xe2 x80 x9d And defendants xe2 x80 x99 response xe2 x80 x9dbrief xe2 x80 x9d n ( doc . 52 ) as discussed in a previous Order ( doc . 57 ) , lacks much substance . For nexample , in addressing issue one ( enterprise liability ) , it states in its unedited nentirety : xe2 x80 x9d [ s ] ee , discussion in the comments and annotations of the 11th Circuit Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions , Exhibits 1 and 2 . Clearly , these ndeterminations involve questions of law for a jury to decide . xe2 x80 x9d Doc . 52. n As made clear in its previous Order , the Court will not sift through cited nbut unargued legal authorities , briefs from other cases , and other documents nincorporated by reference . The Court will not manufacture arguments for Defendants . In essence , responses like Defendants xe2 x80 x99 enterprise liability argument nare no response at all . n Ill n Defendants creative professionals xe2 x80 x9d defense , their response to Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 n nproposed calculation of back pay , and their argument in favor of theirCase 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 9 of 23 n ncounterclaims contain similar flaws . Doc . 52 at 4-6 . For each one , Defendants nbarely respond at all , and when they do , they simply refer the Court to case law nand briefing from another FLSA action involving 1400 and many of the same nissues . Li . n Still , the Court discerns opposition from Defendants xe2 x80 x99 limited xe2 x80 x9dresponses . xe2 x80 x9d It therefore will not deem anything unopposed pursuant to L.R . 7.1 ( B ) , with the nexception of Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 employee/ independent contractor argument ( Defendants nfail to address that issue at all ) . But Defendants did themselves no favors . The nsuccess or failure of Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 summary judgment motion on the issues to which Defendants barely respond thus rises and falls with Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 arguments and n nfacts alone . But first , Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 collateral estoppel argument . n A . Non xe2 x80 x94Mutual Offensive Collateral Estoppel n n xe2 x80 x9dOffensive , nonmutual collateral estoppel is a doctrine under which a nplaintiff asserts that a defendant is barred from litigating an issue based on a ndecision rendered in a case in which the plaintiff was not involved . xe2 x80 x9d Demaree V .

Shore , 439 US . 322 , 327 xe2 x80 x9428 ( 1979 ) ) . xe2 x80 x9dIn order for nonmutual n ncollateral estoppel to apply , the issue currently before the Court ( 1 ) must be n A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) Case 1:15-cv-04453-SCJ Document 58 Filed 06/15/17 Page 10 of 23 n nidentical to the one alleged in the prior litigation ; ( 2 ) the issue must have been nactually litigated ; and ( 3 ) the determination in the prior proceeding must have n nbeen a crucial and necessary part of the judgment in the earlier action . xe2 x80 x9d Berry V. n Great Am .

In Henderson V. 1400 Northside Drive xe2 x80 x94 a case brought by male strippers alleging the same minimum nwage claims Plaintiffs here assert xe2 x80 x94 this Court held that 1400 suffered enterprise nliability under the FLSA because ( 1 ) it had gross annual sales xe2 x80 x9din excess of n $ 500,000 , xe2 x80 x9d and ( 2 ) it engaged in commerce by selling customers alcohol that it nobtained xe2 x80 x9dfrom outside of Georgia . xe2 x80 x9d 2016 WL 3125012 , at *2 ( ND . Ga. June 3 , n2016 ) . It also held that Jones incurred individual liability because he wielded nenough control over 1400 to qualify as an employer . Li . at *3 . In a separate Order , the Court rejected 1400 's creative professional defense because the n nstrippers xe2 x80 x99 dancing did not reflect a sufficiently high degree of creativity . n Henderson V. 1400 Northside Drive Inc. 110 F.

Because Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s motion for an nextension and her summary judgment response were untimely filed , Defendant opposes Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s motion for an extension . ( Doc . 41 ) . n For the reasons stated below , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s motion for an extension ( Doc . 39 ) is GRANTED . I RECOMMEND that Defendant xe2 x80 x99s motion for summary judgment n ( Doc . 35 ) be GRANTED . n I .

Plaintiff stated that she was afraid nof losing her job , and she asked for Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal xe2 x80 x99 s assistance in resolving her concerns . n In response , Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal sent Plaintiff a reply email stating that she had called Sherry Garrett regarding Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s concerns , and Garrett told O xe2 x80 x99Neal that she had just nspoken with Plaintiff and would speak with her again concerning the issues Plaintiff had nraised . ( Doc . 40-2 at 17 ) . Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal told Plaintiff that she hoped her issues would be nresolved , but if they were not , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s next step was to speak directly with the Postmaster . ( I_d. ) . Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal closed by stating that xe2 x80 x9cHR does not get involved in nsituations that can be resolved within the office . xe2 x80 x9d ( I_d. ) . n Following Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s email to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal , Plaintiff met the same day with her nunion steward , Will Stephens , and her direct supervisor , Sherry Garrett , about Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s work hours and overtime . Mr. Stephens informed Ms. Garrett that as a PSE , Plaintiff was not permitted to work over 12 hours a day . ( Moten Dep . at 85 ) . n Ms . Garrett agreed to submit a request for an adjustment with regard to Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s n novertime hours . ( Ld . at 84 , 88 , 109-10 , 112-13 ; Doc . 38-1 at 20 ) . n n11A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 12 of 39 n Starting on or about March 10 , 2014 , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s work hours were significantly nreduced , and Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Saturday work schedule was changed to a split shift where Plaintiff worked from 5:00 am . to 10:30 am , then she returned to work from 3:00 p.m. nto 6:00 p.m. ( Doc . 38-1 at 14 ) . After her work hours were reduced , Plaintiff ncomplained that she was being held accountable for performing her entire dispatch nworkload in half the time . ( Id . at 8 ) . n During Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s period of employment at the Woodstock Post Office , Sherry Garrett observed numerous deficiencies in Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s job performance . ( DSMF HI 12 ) . At an EEO hearing before an administrative judge on May 20 , 2015 , Ms. Garrett ntestified that Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s overall job performance was deficient in the following ways : n The Express Mail was left -- when you do dispatch , it xe2 x80 x99 s your nresponsibility to clean the area to make sure everything is ndispatched on the truck that night . So it doesn xe2 x80 x99t matter who ndoes dispatch , they xe2 x80 x99re to make sure everything is on the ntruck . And so on several occasions , [ Plaintiff ] left Express Mail and it didn xe2 x80 x99t get on the truck . It was more than one noccasion she left Express Mail . It was more overall nperformance . It wasn xe2 x80 x99t just an Express Mail . n It was her overall performance issue . Breaking down mail , nshe would break it down , then the next day she would come nback and ask how to separate classes of mail . Scanning , we nhad scanning issues on several occasions . She misscanned n260 packages one day . The next day she missed 200 nmisscanning packages . She would make the truck late on n n12A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 13 of 39 n nseveral occasions for the dispatch . So , you know , you want nto get the truck loaded and it gets to the plant so your mail ngets out timely . [ A ] nd complaining , she constantly ncomplained a lot about she was working too many hours or nnot enough hours or she was coming in too early or coming nin too late . So it was pretty much overall -- you know , all her nperformance ... n n ( Doc . 38-2 at 14-15 , 17 ) . n On March 18 , 2014 , Ms. Garrett issued Plaintiff a Letter of Warning for failure nto follow instructions .

( Li ) . The letter stated that as a result of Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s nfailure to scan packages properly , the Woodstock Post Office was placed on a non- ncompliant list . ( Li ) . The letter warned that future deficiencies would result in more nsevere disciplinary action being taken against her , including suspensions , reduction in ngrade and/or pay , or removal from the Postal Service . The letter informed Plaintiff that nshe had a right to file a grievance under the grievance/arbitration procedure set forth in Article 15 of the National Agreement within 14 days of her receipt of the letter . ( Li ) . The warning letter was later rescinded pursuant to a settlement agreement between n Sherry Garrett , on behalf of the USPS , and William Stephens , on behalf of the n American Postal Workers Union , due to noncompliance with Article 16 of the collective n n13A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 14 of 39 n nbargaining agreement and the USPS-APWU J 0th Contract Interpretation Manual n n ( xe2 x80 x9cJCIM xe2 x80 x9d ) . ( Doc . 40-3 at 1 ; Moten Dep . at 60 ) . On March 19 , 2014 , Ms. Garrett spoke with Postmaster Ledford about Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s njob performance and possible termination . ( Doc . 40-2 at 3 , 9-10 ; Doc . 38-2 at 7-8 ) . On March 21 , 2014 , Plaintiff sent another email to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal . ( Doc . 38-1 at n24 ) . Plaintiff thanked her for the opportunity to work at the Woodstock Post Office , nsaid that she was relocating very soon to Atlanta , and asked if there were any transfer noptions available at that time or other positions that Plaintiff qualified for . Plaintiff n nclosed by stating that she would continue to check USPS listings daily . ( Id . ; Moten n n n Dep . at 95 ) . n On March 22 , 2014 , Plaintiff reported to work as scheduled .

( Doc . 38-1 at n21 ) . Ms. Garrett commenced the meeting by telling Plaintiff that she ( Garrett ) , Postmaster Todd Ledford , and Ms. Loretta Gomez were unhappy with Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s job nperformance . ( Li ) . Ms. Garrett explained that on Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s first day of work , she had nleft an express mail package under her desk , and on March 19 , 2014 , another express n nmail package that she was responsible for was found in a bucket . ( Li ) . Plaintiff denied n n14A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 15 of 39 n nthat she had left any express mail packages . ( Li ) . Ms. Garrett told Plaintiff that other nemployees had also complained about mail being left behind . n Ms . Garrett gave Plaintiff the option of resigning or being terminated . In her ndeposition , Plaintiff testified that she asked why she should resign . ( Moten Dep . at 94 ) . Donna Vaughn , the union steward , told her that resigning would look better than ntermination , and it would allow Plaintiff to apply for other postal positions . ( Doc . 38-1 nat 21 ) . Plaintiff asked to see the paperwork regarding her termination and her personnel nfolder , and was told by Ms. Garrett that they were not available and there was nothing nin her personnel file regarding the reasons why Plaintiff was being terminated . ( Moten Dep . at 94 ; Doc . 38-1 at 21 ) . Ms. Garrett then asked for Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s badge and told her nthat she was terminated . ( Moten Dep . at 94 ; Doc . 38-1 at 21 ) . Plaintiff clocked out and nwent home . ( Moten Dep . at 94 ) . n Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s OPF contains a letter dated March 22 , 2014 , xe2 x80 x9cSUBJECT : Termination nof Employment , xe2 x80 x9d stating as follows : n This is to advise you that you will be terminated during nprobation from your position of PSE at the Woodstock Post Office at the close of business on Saturday , March 22 , 2014. n Under no circumstances should you work past this date . n This action is being taken due to Unsatisfactory Performance . n n15A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 16 of 39 n U.S .

The letter is signed by xe2 x80 x9cSherry Garrett , [ ] Customer Service Supervisor , Woodstock , Ga. 30188. xe2 x80 x9d ( Doc . 38-1 at 27 ) . Plaintiff asserts that nshe did not receive a copy of her termination letter , however , until it was faxed to her non May 14 , 2014 . ( Doc . 40 , Pl . xe2 x80 x99s Br . in Opp xe2 x80 x99n , at 1 ; Doc . 40-2 at 4 ) . n On Monday , March 24 , 2014 , Plaintiff sent an email to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal informing nher that Plaintiff had been terminated over the weekend , and that the reason given for nterminating her was that her performance was not what the Postmaster and her nsupervisors were looking for . ( Doc . 40-2 at 19 ) . Plaintiff explained that Sherry Garrett nhad offered to allow Plaintiff to resign , but Plaintiff had declined , so Garrett terminated nher . Plaintiff noted that things had gotten xe2 x80 x9cpretty hostile xe2 x80 x9d after her letter of concern n ( i.e. , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s March 3 , 2014 email to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal ) was received . Plaintiff stated , n xe2 x80 x9cI don xe2 x80 x99t know if this termination will hurt my chances of ever being employed [ at ] the Post Office [ but ] [ i ] f I xe2 x80 x99m still eligible for re-hire I will continue to apply . xe2 x80 x9d ( Li ) . n A few days later , Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal contacted Plaintiff and told her that there was a nposition available at the Crown Road facility , and she could find out more about it if n Plaintiff was interested . ( Moten Dep . at 95 ) . Plaintiff expressed an interest in returning n nto the USPS . ( Ld . at 96 ) . When Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal got back to Plaintiff with a more detailed n n16A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 17 of 39 n nexplanation of what the job would involve , Plaintiff learned that she would be working nthe third shift at Crown Road , she would have to serve a new 90-day probationary nperiod , and Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal could not guarantee that Plaintiff would never be laid off for nlack of work like in the past . However , the position was immediately available , and Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal offered to reassign Plaintiff to the Crown Road facility in lieu of termination . n n ( Id . ; Doc . 38-1 at 25 ) . Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal told Plaintiff that under the reas signment , Plaintiff n n n nwould retain her leave computation date and her NTE date would remain J anuary 6 , n2015 . ( DSMF xe2 x80 x98 ] [ 7 ) . n After thinking about the offer for several days , Plaintiff declined Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal xe2 x80 x99s noffer to reassign her to the Crown Road facility . ( Moten Dep . at 96-97 ) . Plaintiff told Ms . O xe2 x80 x99Neal that she felt like she had been wrongfully terminated ; that she did not want nto start back on a new 90-day probationary period ; that if she lost her seniority , she nwould be at risk of being laid off due to lack of work and probably would be the first nto go . Under those circumstances , and without any guaranties that Plaintiff would not nbe laid off or exempted from the 90-day probationary period requirement , Plaintiff told Ms . O xe2 x80 x99Neal that she could not accept the reassignment . ( I_d at 97 ) . n On or about April 8 , 2014 , Plaintiff filed a claim of discrimination with the USPS n Equal Employment Opportunity ( xe2 x80 x9cEEO xe2 x80 x9d ) office . ( Doc . 38-1 at 12 ) . Plaintiff claimed n n17A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 18 of 39 n nthat she was disparately treated , harassed , subj ected to a hostile work environment , and ndiscriminated against 011 the basis of her race ( black ) and seX ( female ) when , on February 8 , 2014 , she was not issued a scan guard for scanning mail ; she was falsely naccused of leaving an express mail package at the office ; on unspecified dates in February , she worked ten hours of overtime , but was not paid for those hours ; on March 3 , 2014 , Plaintiff wrote a letter to Human Resources about harassment at the Woodstock Post Office , and management reduced Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s work hours from six hours nto three hours a day ; on March 22 , 2014 , management told Plaintiff that she was nterminated from the USPS ; and Plaintiff never received anything from the USPS nregarding her termination .

Sherry Garrett was interviewed by na union representative about the reasons for terminating Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s employment . ( Doc . n40-2 at 5-12 [ xe2 x80 x9cGarrett Interview xe2 x80 x9d ] ) . After the inquiry was concluded , Plaintiff was ninformed that there was no resolution to Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s request for counseling , and she had nthe option to file a formal complaint , which apparently Plaintiff did . ( Doc . 38-1 at 1 , n8 , 13 ) . After Plaintiff filed her formal complaint , there was an investigation of her n nclaims . An investigative report was prepared , and a hearing was conducted on May 20 , n n18A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 19 of 39 n n2015 before an administrative judge .

Plaintiff testified that it had to have been Talley , not she , who left the nexpress mail package around the date of Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s termination because she was not at nwork on the day she was accused of having left the package . ( I_d . at 77-80 ) . n Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of sex or race discrimination nbased on disparate treatment . Plaintiff has not provided or pointed to any evidence in nthe record showing that Talley ever failed to dispatch express mail , or that if he did fail nto dispatch express mail , that he was not reprimanded or held responsible for that nfailure . Ms. Garrett testified that she was the supervisor on duty at the times in nquestion , and she had personal knowledge that Plaintiff was assigned dispatch duty on nthose days . ( Doc . 38-2 at 15-16 ) . Ms. Garrett further testified that to her knowledge , Talley never missed scans , never forgot to dispatch any express mail , and his overall nperformance was good .

The express mail did not go out , and Ms. Garrett concluded nthat Plaintiff was responsible . Plaintiff has failed to show that Ms. Garrett xe2 x80 x99 s nexplanation for confronting Plaintiff about the express mail was pretext for race or seX ndiscrimination . Plaintiff has also failed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence to ncreate a triable issue concerning the employer xe2 x80 x99s discriminatory intent . n Finally , Plaintiff has failed to present any argument in opposition to summary njudgment on her express mail disparate treatment claim .

( Moten Dep . at 70-73 ) . n Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s scan guard disparate treatment claim lacks a factual 0r evidentiary nbasis . Plaintiff testified that near the end of her employment at the Woodstock Post Office , Plaintiff learned that there was something called a scan guard that could be used nto help prevent scanning errors . ( Ld . at 71 ) . Plaintiff testified that at some unidentified ntime , Ms. Reinagel told Plaintiff that she had used a scan guard . ( Ld . at 72 ) . However , Plaintiff also testified that Plaintiff never asked for a scan guard , and she never saw Ms . Reinagel use one , even though she and Ms. Reinagle worked on the same shift at nleast 90 percent of the time . ( Li ) . Plaintiff further testified that she did not know Where nscan guards were stored , if scan guards were a piece of equipment that employees had n nto sign out , or that she had any knowledge about scan guards beyond her understanding n n26A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 27 of 39 n nthat they were available or should have been available like any other equipment .

Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence ntending to show that Ms. Garrett or anyone else at the Woodstock Post Office ever nissued Ms. Reinagle ( or any other employee ) a scan guard . Ms. Garrett testified that in nten years , she has never issued a scan guard to any employee . ( Doc . 38-2 at 16 ) . According to the USPS xe2 x80 x99 s EEO office , Postmaster Ledford also reported that none of the Woodstock clerks used a scan guard to scan mail . ( Doc . 38-1 at 18 ) . Plaintiff herself ntestified that she never observed any employee at the Woodstock Post Office use a scan nguard , and she never asked anyone if she could have or use a scan guard . ( Moten Dep . nat 71-72 ) . Plaintiff argues that Postmaster Ledford testified that scan guards were nordered after Plaintiff was terminated , but this argument undermines rather than nsupports her contention that she was disparately treated . ( Doc . 40 at 2 ; Doc . 40-2 at n16 ) . n Plaintiff has failed to show that Ms. Reinagle was treated more favorably than nshe .

( Li . at 79 ) . n Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence in the record suggesting that she nparticipated in any formal investigation or proceeding before she was terminated on March 22 , 2014 . The record shows that she did not file a complaint With the EEO office nuntil April 2014 . Accordingly , the Court will assume that Plaintiff is asserting that n nsending her email to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal on March 3 , 2014 was protected activity . n n34A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 35 of 39 n Making informal complaints to superiors about suspected illegal discrimination n nmay qualify as protected expression under the opposition clause of Title VII .

Nevertheless , not every informal complaint made by n nan employee automatically qualifies as a protected expression that shields the employee n nfrom subsequent retaliation . White , 2006 WL 2443848 , at *25. n n n For an employee xe2 x80 x99s opposition activity to be protected under the anti-retaliation nprovision of Title VII , the employee must be opposing conduct that is made an n xe2 x80 x9cunlawful employment practice xe2 x80 x9d by Title VII . I_d . Title VII defines an xe2 x80 x9cunlawful nemployment practice xe2 x80 x9d as , inter alia , discrimination against an employee xe2 x80 x9cWith respect nto his compensation , terms , conditions , or privileges of employment , because of such nindividual xe2 x80 x99s race , color , religion , seX , or national origin . xe2 x80 x9d 42 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 2000e-2 ( a ) . In other words , it is not enough for a plaintiff to show that she opposed garden-variety nunfairness or harsh treatment in the workplace ; she is only protected from retaliation if n nthe practice she opposed or complained about is specifically prohibited by Title VII . n n35A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 36 of 39 n White , 2006 WL 2443848 , at *26. n n n With regard to Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s reduction-in-hours claim , Plaintiff testified that she felt nlike she was treated differently than her comparator , Seth Talley . ( Moten Dep . at 80-82 , n85-86 ) . The record shows that for several weeks before Plaintiff sent her March 3 , 2014 nemail , Plaintiff was complaining that her hours were too long . On or about March 10 , n2014 , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s hours were reduced . Plaintiff then became concerned that the nreduction in her work hours was too drastic and she was not being given the same time nto complete her dispatch as her white male counterpart , Seth Talley . ( Moten Dep . at 80 , n85 ; Doc . 38-1 at 8 ) . Plaintiff claims that her hours were reduced in retaliation for nvoicing her concerns about her work situation . n Defendant xe2 x80 x99s uncontroverted evidence shows that between March 10 , 2014 and n Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s termination on the 22nd , Plaintiff worked twelve days , while PSE Talley nworked nine days . ( DSMF HI 19 ) . Plaintiff worked 92.19 hours during this period , and n PSE Talley worked 68.22 hours . ( Id . ; Doc . 38-1 at 29-34 , 35-38 ) . During the days both n n n Plaintiff and Talley worked the same day , Plaintiff worked 71.74 hours , while Talley n nworked 68.22 . ( DSMF HI 20 ) . In her response brief , Plaintiff concedes that the record nshows she worked more hours than Talley did . ( Doc . 40 at 2 ) . n With regard to her termination , it is undisputed that Plaintiff suffered an adverse n n36A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 37 of 39 n nemployment action when she was terminated on March 22 , 2014 . However , Plaintiff nhas failed to show that she opposed conduct that is specifically prohibited by Title VII . Plaintiff admitted in her deposition that her March 3rd email to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal did not nconstitute an internal complaint of race- or gender-based discrimination under Title VII . n ( Moten Dep . at 91-92 ) . It is undisputed that the email sent by Plaintiff to Ms. O xe2 x80 x99Neal ndid not reference Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s race , gender , or other protected classification . Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s nemail raised concerns regarding the lack of a time card , schedule changes , long hours , nand treatment by Loretta Gomez , but did not allege that these issues were due to any ntype of discrimination or discriminatory conduct prohibited by Title VII . Plaintiff has nfailed to show that she engaged in any protected activity prior to the reduction in her nhours and her separation from the Woodstock Post Office . n In sum , Plaintiff has failed to establish that her work hours were reduced more nthan Talley xe2 x80 x99 s , or that Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s hours were reduced for retaliatory purposes . Plaintiff nhas also failed to show that she engaged in any protected activity , much less a causal nconnection between such activity and her discharge . For the reasons stated , I recommend that Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s retaliation n nclaims be granted . n n37A0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 38 of 39 n E . Other Contentions n Finally , Plaintiff does not allege in her Complaint but argues in her response brief nthat she was wrongfully terminated because she was not a probationary employee at the ntime of her discharge . ( Doc . 40 at 2 ) . Plaintiff , however , has failed to point to or nprovide any probative evidence that would support such a claim . The only evidence nshe has submitted to support her assertion is an unsigned , unauthenticated , undated nstatement of union contentions in an earlier proceeding asserting that Plaintiff was not na probationary employee and her termination violated certain contractual obligations nbetween the union and the USPS . ( Doc . 40-4 at 1-3 ) . The statement does not mention Title VII or assert that Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s termination was in any way discriminatory or nretaliatory on the basis of race , seX , or any other protected characteristic . n In addition to being unauthenticated , inadmissible hearsay , this evidence is not nprobative of whether Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s reasons for terminating Plaintiff were a cloak for race nor seX discrimination . Plaintiff has made no attempt to link her contention that she was nnot a probationary employee to her Title VII claims . Nor has Plaintiff provided nsufficient probative evidence showing that Ms. Garrett xe2 x80 x99 s reasons for terminating Plaintiff were implausible or not worthy of belief . Plaintiff has also failed to show how n nthe record evidence creates a genuine is sue of material fact as to intent or pretext , based n n38Case 1:15-cv xe2 x80 x9404515-AT Document 43 Filed 04/18/17 Page 39 of 39 n non the nature of the reasons offered in combination With other circumstantial evidence .

This Court , however , concludes that Defendant is incorrect . n In the Order of March 23 , 2016 , [ Doc . 804 in Case No . 1:15-CV-55555 ] , this Court held that the two-year statute of limitations applies to the Fair Labor Standards Act suits pending in this Court against Defendant . Accordingly , Plaintiff Harris xe2 x80 x99 nclaims to overtime pay are limited to those workweeks beginning on April 23 , 2013 , nand Plaintiff Gibson xe2 x80 x99s claims begin on May 5 , 2013 . There is no indication that these Plaintiffs intend to argue that they are entitled to any type of equitable tolling based non what happened in Rind xef xac x82eisch and Biiley , and , if they did , Defendant would ncertainly argue strenuously ( and rightfully ) that these are entirely new cases and there n nis no basis to conclude that Plaintiffs are entitled to tolling because of the earlier failed n ncases . This Court thus concludes that it would likewise be improper to look back atA0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 846 Filed 09/08/16 Page 5 of 7 n nwhat happened in those earlier cases to determine what Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 duties and rights nwere with respect to their claims as they relate to their bankruptcy actions . Accordingly , this Court will ignore Rind xef xac x82eisch and Ba_iley in analyzing the parties xe2 x80 x99 narguments . n Turning xef xac x81rst to the question of Plaintiff Harris xe2 x80 x99 claims , she xef xac x81led her suit well nafter she xef xac x81led her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition , and the fact that her bankruptcy case nlingered beyond the date that she xef xac x81led her suit here is of no consequence because , as na general matter , Chapter 7 debtors retain possession of property xe2 x80 x94 including legal n nclaims xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x94 -- acquired after they xef xac x81le their bankruptcy petition .

In re Simmons , 520 BR . n136 , 144 ( Bankr . M.D .

Defendant has xef xac x81led a motion in the cases pending before the nundersigned seeking an order adopting these rulings by J udge J ones . [ Doc . 623 ] . n At the outset , this Court disagrees with Defendant that the law of the case ndoctrine applies to Judge Jones xe2 x80 x99 rulings . Under that doctrine , a ruling made in a ncertain case remains binding on the parties in that case . Rind xef xac x82eish orders made after ndeserti xef xac x81cation of the class in that case are not binding on these cases . However , this Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it can construe Defendant xe2 x80 x99s motion as one seeking nsummary judgment on the issues raised , and for obvious reasons of j udicial ef xef xac x81ciency , nthis Court Will do just that . In such event , Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate the same narguments that were raised by the plaintiffs in Rind xef xac x82eisch in response to Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s nsummary judgment motions . [ Doc . 640 at 4 ] . n This Court has carefully reviewed Judge J ones xe2 x80 x99 extensive xef xac x81ndings of fact and nthe conclusions based upon those xef xac x81ndings in the two orders from Rind xef xac x82eisch nmentioned above . With one exception discussed below , this Court agrees fully with J udge J ones and adopts those conclusions into this case . Accordingly , this Court now nconcludes that ( 1 ) Defendant did not act willfully in Violating the FLSA by nimplementing the PPV Plan , and the FLSA xe2 x80 x99s two-year statute of limitations applies nto Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 claims against Defendant , ( 2 ) Defendant acted in good faith in adopting n nthe PPV Plan so that Plaintiffs are not entitled to recover liquidated damages under theA0 72A n ( Rev.8/82 ) n Case 1:15-mi-55555-WBH Document 804 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 3 n Act , and ( 3 ) the accurate measure of the Plaintiffs xe2 x80 x99 damages in these cases is half xe2 x80 x94time npay for the hours that the plaintiffs worked in excess of forty in any one week . n This Court will not , however , adopt Judge J ones xe2 x80 x99 stance as it relates to experts n xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x94 at least not yet . In the order of November 24 , 2016 , this Court expressed its nskepticism that expert testimony is required to resolve the issues in this case . That nskepticism still holds , but as there does not seem to be any expert testimony to strike nat this time , this Court will limit its holding by requiring only that the parties obtain nleave of this Court before beginning discovery related to expert witnesses . n For the reasons stated , Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s motion , [ Doc . 623 ] , is GRANTED , and this n Court adopts Judge J ones xe2 x80 x99 orders from the Rind xef xac x82eish case as discussed . n IT IS SO ORDERED , this Z7/day of March , 2016. n WILLIS B .

However , a thorough examination of the evidence nin the record does not support Bynum xe2 x80 x99s Cherry xe2 x80 x94picking of deposition excerpts in an nattempt to support his limited View . More importantly , the evidence cited by Bynum does not contradict the evidence presented by Defendant detailing the more ncomplete picture of her job description . n For example , Bynum cites an excerpt from the deposition of her fellow n ninvestigator , Michelle Magwood , in Which Magwood testi xef xac x81es that her n n17Case 1:16-cv-00001-MHC Document 44 Filed 07/10/17 Page 18 of 23 n ninvestigatory duties as an investigator was limited to interviewing witnesses , nsurveillance , and writing reports .

Rather , the Magwood testimony is not inconsistent with Defendant xe2 x80 x99s evidence . n Bynum also cites deposition testimony from her supervisor , Lt.

In fact , ,if one reviews n na more complete excerpt of the deposition testimony from Hester , see Hester Dep . n n n nat 118-22 , it is clear that it is consistent with Defendant xe2 x80 x99s position . For example , in nresponse to a question suggesting that a CCSD PD investigator does nothing other nthan transcribe information for others to use in making signi xef xac x81cant decisions , Hester clearly states that the investigators do not merely conduct the investigations ; n nrather , they assess the information they collect and make recommendations as to n n18Case 1:16-cv-00001-MHC Document 44 Filed 07/10/17 Page 19 of 23 n Whether a crime occurred , Whether probable cause exists , and Whether an arrest n nwarrant should be sought . n Q : So I get the xef xac x81le .

Defendants xe2 x80 x99 decision to terminate Ms . Wiley on account of her protected whistleblower activity violated her clearly nestablished free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and her n nrights as a public employee under the Georgia Whistleblower Act.Case 1:16 xe2 x80 x94cv xe2 x80 x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 11 of 27 n n37 . During that conversation , Hampton also incredibly told Ms. Wiley that she n nneeded to justify Why she should not be placed on a leave of absence because of n nher lawsuit . n38 . n Ms . Wiley was stunned by these comments and confused as her lawsuit nagainst her former employer had nothing to do With her employment With the City nof Atlanta nor any public service , policy or transaction involving the City of Atlanta . n n39 . n Upon information and belief , Patrick shared the contents of Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s nlawsuit With Hampton . n n40 . n Per Hampton xe2 x80 x99s instructions , Ms. Wiley contacted Hampton xe2 x80 x99s assistant and nscheduled an appointment to meet With Hampton on Wednesday , J anuary 7 , 2015. n n41 . n Following Ms. Wiley 's conversation With Hampton and Patrick , Ms. Wiley n nwas anxious and concerned that Hampton xe2 x80 x99s response to Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s disclosure of n nher Whistleblower lawsuit had placed her job With the City in jeopardy , even n n11Case 1:16 xe2 x80 x94cv xe2 x80 x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 12 of 27 n nthough her lawsuit had nothing to do With the City of Atlanta or any of the duties nthat Ms. Wiley performed for the City . n42 . n The following Monday , J anuary 5 , 2015 , When everyone returned to the noffice from the holiday break , Hampton xe2 x80 x99s assistant cancelled Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s npreviously scheduled meeting on J anuary 7 , 2015 Without any explanation . n n43 . n Throughout the morning of J anuary 5 , 2015 in the office , Patrick nuncharacteristically avoided contact With Ms. Wiley , and When they did interact , Patrick was cold and dismissive xe2 x80 x94 unlike the previously warm and collegial nrelationship that Ms. Wiley had experienced before With Patrick . n n44 . n That same morning , Hampton convened a meeting With all of the xe2 x80 x9cDeputies nand Chiefs xe2 x80 x9d in a conference room . When Ms. Wiley entered the room , Hampton ndid not speak to her . n n45 . During the meeting , Ms. Wiley noticed that Patrick appeared visibly upset n nand realized that something was seriously wrong . n n12Case 1:16 xe2 x80 x94cv xe2 x80 x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 13 of 27 n n46 . n Immediately after the meeting , Hampton excused everyone except Patrick nand Robert Godfrey , the Chief Counsel who handles employment litigation for the City . n n47 . n A few minutes later , Patrick called Ms. Wiley into her office , where Godfrey nwas also waiting . In front of Godfrey , Patrick told Ms. Wiley that she was being nterminated , effective immediately . n n48 . n Ms . Wiley asked Patrick for an explanation for her termination . Patrick nrefused to explain and coldly said over and over that Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cservices were nno longer needed . xe2 x80 x9d When Ms. Wiley asked if she was being terminated because of nher whistleblower lawsuit , Patrick refused to provide any further explanation for Ms . Wiley xe2 x80 x99s abrupt termination . n n49 . n After Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s repeated request for an explanation for her abrupt n ntermination , Patrick offered Ms. Wiley the option of resigning her employment n nwith the City of Atlanta . n n13Case 1:16 xe2 x80 x94cv xe2 x80 x9400031-CC Document 1 Filed 01/05/16 Page 14 of 27 n n50 . n Because Ms. Wiley had not done anything wrong and needed her job with n nthe City , Ms. Wiley refused to resign her employment . n51 . n Following Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s termination , the City of Atlanta falsely reported to nthe Georgia Department of Labor that Ms. Wiley had voluntarily resigned her nposition . n n52 . n The City of Atlanta has adopted a xe2 x80 x9cBill of Rights xe2 x80 x9d to guide the City Council , Mayor , and all departments of City government . Section 2 0f the City xe2 x80 x99s Bill of Rights states that xe2 x80 x9c [ t ] he City of Atlanta shall not interfere with the rights of nfreedom of speech , of freedom of the press , to petition the government , 0r 0f n npeaceable assembly . xe2 x80 x9d n n53 .

Wiley xe2 x80 x99s Whistleblower lawsuit had no impact on the effective operation nof the City or the provision of services to the City by the Department of Law , nbecause the City was not a party to the lawsuit and the allegations contained in the nlawsuit had nothing to do With Ms. Wiley xe2 x80 x99s employment With the City .

Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Prima Facie Case n Under the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework , a plaintiff can generally nestablish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under Title VII by showing nthat : 1 ) he is a member of a protected class ; 6 2 ) he was subjected to an adverse nemployment action by his employer ; 3 ) he was qualified to do the job in question ; and n4 ) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his protected nclassification ( i.e. , those of a different seX , race , or religion ) more favorably than it ntreated him . See McDonnell Douglas , 411 US . at 802 ; see also Wright v. Southland Corp. , 187 F.3d 1287 , 1290 ( 11th Cir . 1999 ) ; Holifield v. Reno , 115 F.3d 1555 , 1562 n ( 11th Cir . 1997 ) . The Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff is a member of a nprotected class and he was qualified to do the job in question . Defendant contends , nhowever , that Plaintiff can not establish a prima facie case of race discrimination nbecause he has failed to present evidence showing that Stratas treated anyone outside n nhis protected class more favorably than it treated him . The Court agrees . n n6 Although courts continue to include the requirement that a plaintiff establish nas part of a prima facie case that he or she is a member of a xe2 x80 x9cprotected class , xe2 x80 x9d it is nclear that individuals of any seX , race , or religion may pursue claims of employment ndiscrimination under Title VII . See Wright v. Southland Corp. , 187 F.3d 1287 , 1290 nn.3 ( 11th Cir . 1999 ) ( Citing McDonald v. Santa F e Trail Transp . C0. , 427 US . 273 , n278-80 ( 1976 ) ) . Thus , the key element of the prima facie case is establishing that npersons outside of the plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s protected classification ( i.e. , those of a different seX , nrace , or religion ) were treated more favorably by the employer .

It is Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s burden , however , to prove his claims , nand specifically to demonstrate there is evidence of material fact to establish a prima nfacie case of discrimination . Notably , Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence that any Caucasian employees , or , indeed , any other employees at all other than Breeden , nviolated the Employee Purchase Program . n Plaintiff makes other conclusory allegations , claiming that xe2 x80 x9c [ t ] he disparity nbetween the treatment of white employees and the African-American employees who nwere terminated is clear xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9c [ t ] here is no question that the actions of the recently- nhired Caucasian plant manager treated any non-African-American in a similar nfashion . xe2 x80 x9d Id . In addition , Plaintiff argues that xe2 x80 x9call the evidence before this Court nindicates that Defendant restructured its management and proceed to systematically neliminate long-term African-American employees at an astonishing rate . xe2 x80 x9d Id . But Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s general allegations cite to no record evidence and are wholly unsupported nby the facts outlined above . n Moreover , to the extent that Plaintiff relies on the allegation that there were nwhite employees selling oil to Plaintiff , and that these white employees were not nterminated , Plaintiff neither cites to record evidence to support this contention nor n naddresses the proper question xe2 x80 x94 whether there were white employees who were n n23Case 1:16-cv xe2 x80 x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 24 of 35 n nengaged in storing oil on Stratas xe2 x80 x99s premises who were not terminated . In addition , neven if Plaintiff were addressing the proper issue , there is nothing to indicate from nwhom Plaintiff purchased oil in excess of the four jugs he was allowed to purchase nfrom Stratas per pay period . Without any citations to evidence to support these nallegations , it is simply impossible for the Court to determine whether the Plaintiff has npresented sufficient evidence to establish that there were other employees who were nsimilarly situated to the Plaintiff in all relevant respects and committed similar ninfractions , but were treated differently . For these reasons , the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence that Defendant treated a similarly nsituated Caucasian employee more favorably than it treated Plaintiff . n Accordingly , the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient nevidence to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination under Title VII and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment . Even assuming that he had done so , nhowever , the Court finds that Defendant has presented a legitimate reason for the Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s termination , and Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of npretext . n n2 . Defendant xe2 x80 x99s Legitimate Reason The Court finds that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it had a n nlegitimate reason for the Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s termination that was not based on his race .

In sum , Defendant contends that it terminated Plaintiff because he was xe2 x80 x9cstaging xe2 x80 x9d the oil he npurchased outside the Shipping Department , in Violation of the express instruction set nforth on the Order Form for purchases under the Employee Purchase Program . Def . SMF xe2 x80 x98 ] [ xe2 x80 x98 ] [ 18-19 . Because Defendant required employees to remove oil right away after npurchasing it through the Employee Purchase Program in order to keep track of its ninventory , and Plaintiff repeatedly violated the instruction , Defendant terminated Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s employment . n It is undisputed that since November 21 , 2011 , the Valdosta Plant had an Employee Purchase Program in place under Which employees could purchase oil from Stratas for their personal use . Def . SMF at HI 14 . Through the Employee Purchase Program , oil was made available to employees of Stratas at a lower price than that Which Stratas charged its customers . Def . SMF at HI 15 . Thus , there was a limit on the namount of oil employees could purchase xe2 x80 x94 a maximum of two jugs of each of two nkinds of oil , i.e. , four jugs of oil per pay period . Def . SMF at xe2 x80 x98 ] [ xe2 x80 x98 ] [ 16-17 . As part of the Employee Purchase Program , employees had to fill out an Order Form and pick up ntheir orders from the Shipping Department at specified times . Def . SMF at HI 18 . When nan employee picks up his order , he is supposed to promptly take it to his vehicle and n nemployees are not allowed to store their oil sales outside of the shipping office or in n n25Case 1:16-cv xe2 x80 x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 26 of 35 n nthe warehouse according to the terms of the Order Form . Def . SMF at HI 19 . This nrequirement is in place to ensure that Stratas can properly account for and track all njugs of oil leaving the warehouse . Def .

Def . SMF at HI 21 . Though Plaintiff was allowed to park inside , it was still sometimes difficult for him to load the npurchased oil into his vehicle right away . Def . SMF at M 23-24 .

Def . SMF at HI 25 . Specifically , the Witness saw Plaintiff taking jugs of oil out nan open fire door and toward Breeden xe2 x80 x99 s car . Def . SMF at HI 26 .

Def . SMF at HI 33. n In sum , the Court finds that the Defendant has met the burden of presenting nsufficient evidence that it had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s employment . Thus , in order for Plaintiff to defeat the Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s Motion n nfor Summary J udgment , he must cite to competent evidence in the record that would n n27Case 1:16-cv xe2 x80 x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 28 of 35 n nbe sufficient to establish that Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s proffered reason is a pretext for ndiscrimination . n3 . Pretext n A plaintiff may carry the burden of showing that the employer xe2 x80 x99s proffered nreasons are pretextual by showing that they have no basis in fact , that they were not nthe true factors motivating the decision , or that the stated reasons were insufficient to nmotivate the decision . A plaintiff can either directly persuade the court that a ndiscriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or show indirectly that the nemployer xe2 x80 x99s ultimate justification is not believable .

In other words , the plaintiff has the opportunity to come nforward with evidence , including the previously produced evidence establishing the nprima facie case , sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the nreasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment ndecision .

Br . nat 7 . Citing Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp. , 644 F.3d 1321 , 1328 ( 11th Cir . 2011 ) , Plaintiff attempts to use the case to skirt over the fact that he can not show that a n nsimilarly situated individual outside the protected class was treated more favorably n n29Case 1:16-cv xe2 x80 x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 30 of 35 n nthan he was and declares that xe2 x80 x9cit is clear that a genuine issue of material fact exists . xe2 x80 x9d P1 . Br . at 7. n In Smith , the Eleventh Circuit determined that the plaintiff did not need to rely non the McDonnell Douglas presumption because xe2 x80 x9cthe record contained sufficient nevidence to allow a jury to infer that [ Defendant ] Lockheed fired [ Plaintiff ] Mitten nbecause he is white . xe2 x80 x9d Smith , 644 F.3d at 1328 . Although the plaintiff had failed to nshow that he was disciplined less favorably under a zero tolerance policy than a nsimilarly situated black employee , the plaintiff had shown that there were npreferentially treated black employees in non-supervisory positions . Id . at 1326 . In naddition , Plaintiff had set forth evidence that yielded the inference of race ndiscrimination , including that Lockheed xe2 x80 x9chad a substantial incentive to discipline nwhite employees more harshly than black employees xe2 x80 x9d because it had received bad npublicity and that xe2 x80 x9cLockheed consciously injected race considerations into its ndiscipline decision making without an adequate explanation for doing so xe2 x80 x9d when it nused a xe2 x80 x9cmatrix xe2 x80 x9d that included race in making disciplinary decisions . Id . at 1341 . Thus , neven though the plaintiff could not meet the fourth prong 0f the McDonnell Douglas nframework , the Eleventh Circuit found that there was sufficient circumstantial nevidence in the record to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s n ntermination was because of his race . That is , though deeming a person similarly n n30Case 1:16-cv-00081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 4 of 35 n Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s objections to Defendant xe2 x80 x99s Statement of Material Facts are almost nexclusively premised on Local Rule 56.1B ( 1 ) ( a ) , that is , that the citation to the record Defendant puts forth does not support Defendant xe2 x80 x99s factual allegation . However , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s objections concerning Defendant xe2 x80 x99s citations to the record are overruled . Defendant attached three exhibits to its Motion for Summary J udgment , and though nits references to the page numbers Within the exhibits cite to the original page numbers nof Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s deposition and the other documents , rather than to the page number nentered in the Court xe2 x80 x99s filing system , Defendant properly cites support for its factual nallegations.2 n Plaintiff also substantively disputes some of Defendant xe2 x80 x99s proffered facts , but nthe maj ority of these disputes are over minor and immaterial is sues.3 Accordingly , the Court Will not rule on each and every objection or dispute presented by the parties , nand Will discuss those objections and disputes in the analysis section only When nnecessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact . Finally , the Court notes that Plaintiff misnumbers his obj ections as to Defendant xe2 x80 x99s Statement of Material Facts beginning at Paragraphs 21 and 22 . Thus , Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s responses to n Defendant xe2 x80 x99s Statement of Material Facts diverge at Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Paragraph 22 ( which n n2In referencing Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s deposition , Which is Defendant xe2 x80 x99 s Exhibit A , the Court nadopts Defendant xe2 x80 x99s method of citation . n n3Moreover , few of Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s responses actually cite to any record evidence . n n4Case 1:16-cv xe2 x80 x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 31 of 35 n nsituated may require that the person occupy the same position as the plaintiff , that is nnot the exclusive means by Which to document evidence of racial discrimination . n Thus , While it is true that the McDonnell Douglas framework is not meant to nbe applied rigidly , and a plaintiff may raise a reasonable inference of an employer xe2 x80 x99s ndiscriminatory intent through various forms of circumstantial evidence , see Smith , 644 F.3d at 1328 , there must be evidence from Which a factfinder could infer intentional ndiscrimination by the decisionmaker . Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s allegation , however , is nothing more nthan a conclusory statement that is unsupported by any evidence in the record and his nreliance on Smith is unfounded . n Moreover , Plaintiff suggests that because Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class , was terminated , and had the ability to do the njob , there is automatically a genuine is sue of material fact such that summary njudgment is unwarranted . See id . ( xe2 x80 x9cThat Defendant concedes the fact that three out of nfour tests have been decided in Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s favor makes it clear that summary judgment nis wholly inappropriate in this matter . xe2 x80 x9d ) . This is an incorrect interpretation of the nshowing required by a plaintiff to put forth a primafacie case of race discrimination , nand a Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s burden to show pretext is a heavier one than to set forth a primafacie ncase . Reliance on Smith for purposes of this argument is , as explained above , n ninapposite . n n31Case 1:16-cv xe2 x80 x9400081-RWS Document 43 Filed 03/24/17 Page 32 of 35 n Plaintiff has provided no evidence to support his allegations . Indeed , even Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99 s testimony does not indicate that Metzler was motivated in any way by race . Plaintiff testified that Metzler refused to speak to all people who worked on the xef xac x82oor nof the Plant xe2 x80 x94 whether African-American or Caucasian . He also testified that the people nwho worked upstairs , in offices near Metzler and away from the Plant xef xac x82oor , were both Caucasian and African-American . Plaintiff testified that one Caucasian employee , nwho was a xe2 x80 x9cleadman , xe2 x80 x9d like Plaintiff , also had a desk upstairs . Def . EX . A at 211-14. However , there is no evidence that the Caucasian employee engaged in similar nconduct to Plaintiff , i.e. , staged oil on Stratas xe2 x80 x99s premises , or that his duties were nsimilar to Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s because he was not a part of the Packaging Department . This nalone , then , is not evidence of any kind of pervasive atmosphere of race ndiscrimination . Though Plaintiff believes that Metzler was motivated by race , he has nproffered no evidence that supports these allegations at all . n The bottom line is that Plaintiff has provided no record support for his beliefs , nand the Court can not sit in judgment of an employer xe2 x80 x99 s decision , absent evidence that na discriminatory motive was the underlying basis . As the Eleventh Circuit has nexplained : n Title VII does not take away an employer xe2 x80 x99 s right to interpret its rules as n nit chooses , and to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules . n Title VII addresses discrimination . . . . Title VII is not a shield against nharsh treatment at the workplace .

The employer may fire an nemployee for a good reason , a bad reason , a reason based an erroneous nfacts , or for no reason at all , as long as its action is not for a ndiscriminatory reason . While an employer xe2 x80 x99 s judgment or course of action nmay seem poor or erroneous to outsiders , the relevant question is simply Whether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination .

The Contract is Not Ambiguous n Under Georgia law , contract construction involves three steps : First , the ntrial court must decide Whether the language is clear and unambiguous ; if so , the ncourt enforces the contract according to its clear terms , looking only to the n ncontract itself for guidance as to its meaning .

If the ncontract is ambiguous , the court must apply the rules of contract construction to nresolve the ambiguity . Li . If the contract remains ambiguous after those rules are napplied , the question of What the ambiguous language means and What the parties nintended must be resolved by a jury .

Rather , the four-year nlimitations period provided in 28 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 1658 applies to Section 1981 by ndefault . Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s argument that Section 1981 xe2 x80 x9cincorporates xe2 x80 x9d this limitations nperiod is unavailing xe2 x80 x94nowhere in its text does Section 1981 refer to 28 U.S.C . xc2 xa7 n1658 , or to any limitations period at all . E Kwok V. Delta Air Lines Inc. , 994 F. Supp . 2d 1290 , 1294 ( N.D.

Specifically , she reads the word xe2 x80 x9ccontains xe2 x80 x9d to include xe2 x80 x9cincorporates xe2 x80 x9d or xe2 x80 x9cis nsubject to , xe2 x80 x9d and the word xe2 x80 x9cseparate xe2 x80 x9d to refer to having an applicable federal n nstatute of limitations rather than having to borrow one from state law .

The fact that Ms. Lilley was presented with the Contract on a xe2 x80 x9ctake-it xe2 x80 x94or xe2 x80 x94leave-it xe2 x80 x9d nbasis does not alter this result . n Moreover , plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s suggested interpretation of the Contract fails to nsupport her argument that the Contract is subject to multiple interpretations , nbecause her interpretation would lead to an absurd result . Under plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s ninterpretation of the Contract , the language excluding xe2 x80 x9cFederal ciVil rights statutes ncontaining a separate limitations period xe2 x80 x9d would never apply , because any statute ncontaining no limitations period would xe2 x80 x9cincorporate xe2 x80 x9d or be xe2 x80 x9csubject to xe2 x80 x9d a nlimitations period by case law .

However , nreading the Contract as Inalfa does shows that this result is not actually arbitrary . Instead , as plaintiff later observes , it leads to the result that only statutes that ncontain administrative exhaustion requirements , such as Title VII , would not be ncovered by the 180-day limitation.10 Plaintiff contends that if this was the result Inalfa intended , it xe2 x80 x9ccould have simply said so . xe2 x80 x9d But the fact that Inalfa did not ndoes not render the parties xe2 x80 x99 agreement less binding or their intent less clear . n Finally , Ms. Lilley xe2 x80 x99s contention that this interpretation is xe2 x80 x9cunnecessary xe2 x80 x9d nbecause the law already prohibits contractually shortening statutes of limitations nthat affect administrative exhaustion requirements also fails . She is correct that ncourts xe2 x80 x9cmust read the contract to give meaning to each and every word it contains xe2 x80 x9d n n9 n nand xe2 x80 x9cavoid treating a word as redundant or mere surplusage . xe2 x80 x99 Eguity Lifestyle n n10 Notably , Section 1981 does not have an administrative exhaustion nrequirement .

Ms. Lilley was nterminated on December 10 , 2014 . In order to timely bring her Section 1981 nretaliation claim , plaintiff was required to file suit by June 8 , 2015 .

( P1 . xe2 x80 x99s Mot . 1 . ) Plaintiff states that the Title VII Claim could not have been brought n nearlier because , despite the fact that the EEOC issued a Notice of Right to Sue n n n Letter ( the xe2 x80 x9cRTS Letter xe2 x80 x9d ) on March 5 , 2015 , ( see Lilley Decl .

( Li . at 5-9 . ) Inalfa responds that plaintiff was nnot diligent in pursuing her Title VII Claim and has not shown good cause for her ndelay because she failed to contact the EEOC to inquire about the RTS Letter nbefore the amendment deadline and failed to review the address listed on the ncharge for accuracy . ( Def . xe2 x80 x99s Resp .

However , they disagree on the napplication of the case-by-case approach here . Plaintiff states that the failure to nreceive the RTS Letter was in no way her fault because , xe2 x80 x9cdue to a series of nadministrative errors by the EEOC , the RTS Notice was not issued to Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s ncounsel and was mailed without including Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s full address . xe2 x80 x9d ( Pl . xe2 x80 x99s Mot . 2 . ) Specifically , plaintiff asserts that she provided her full mailing address on the Intake Questionnaire she completed when filing the charge , but that the n ninvestigator failed to copy her apartment number onto the charge . ( Li . at 3 ; see n n n nal xef xac x82 Lilley Decl . Exs . A & B . ) Although the EEOC Investigator told Ms. Lilley nto review the xe2 x80 x9cfacts xe2 x80 x9d section of the form , which she did , he did not mention the naddress section , so she did not review it . ( Pl . xe2 x80 x99s Mot . at 3 . ) n Plaintiff further argues that the failure to receive the RTS Letter is in no nway her fault because the letter was not sent to her counsel . Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s counsel nsent a Letter of Representation t0 the EEOC on J anuary 20 , 2015 , requesting that nthe EEOC send all future correspondence to him , which the EEOC acknowledged . n n ( Pl . xe2 x80 x99s Mot . at 3 ; see also Stark Decl .

( P1 . xe2 x80 x99s Mot . 3-4 . ) The EEOC eventually issued the RTS Letter on March 5 , 2015 ( @ Lilley Decl . [ 30 xe2 x80 x941 ] EX .

( P1 . xe2 x80 x99s Mot . 4 . ) Thus , plaintiff and her counsel ndid not receive the RTS Letter ; they were made aware of it only after her counsel ninquired about it on June 9 , 2016 . ( Li ) n Defendant responds that plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Motion to Amend is untimely , because nthe facts underlying her Title VII Claim are identical to those underlying her Section 1981 claim , so she was already aware of them at the time she filed the Complaint . ( Def . xe2 x80 x99s Resp . 4 . ) She has not shown good cause for delay , defendant nargues , because had she exercised diligence in pursuing her claim , she would nhave reviewed the address information on the charge form , sought confirmation nfrom the EEOC that no notice of right to sue had been issued before the n Scheduling Order xe2 x80 x99s deadline , or simply requested such a1etter within 180 days of n nthe filing of her charge pursuant to 29 CPR . xc2 xa7 1601.28 ( a ) .

Plaintiff xe2 x80 x99s Title VII retaliation Claim relies on the same facts underlying her Section 1981 claim . Thus , unless nplaintiff can show that she did not receive the RTS Letter through no fault of her nown , she can not show good cause for failing to assert her Title VII claim earlier . Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged good cause for her delay . Neither she nor nher counsel was aware that the EEOC had concluded its investigation of her nclaim ; in fact , counsel for plaintiff sent additional evidence at the EEOC xe2 x80 x99s request , nso it was reasonable for both to assume that the investigation was still underway .

There was no reason nplaintiff or her attorney should have been on notice that the RTS Letter had been nissued and mailed when they reasonably believed the investigation was ongoing .

That responsibility , however , need not extend to correcting internal nerrors at the EEOC . This is not a case where plaintiff moved and failed to keep nthe EEOC informed of her updated address .

Thus , the npresumption of receipt of the original RTS Letter does not apply . Instead , the ndate of actual receipt xe2 x80 x94June 10 , 2016 xe2 x80 x94triggers the 90-day period .
